1frz4z4,harvard,Too many options,"Upperclassmen,

How did you deal with having so many interesting courses to choose from. If someone is for example interested in a couple different fields of physics or math or history or anything else consecutively, how did you narrow it down or decide?","['\nI didn’t come to Harvard for undergrad; what I did when I was in undergrad a decade ago was I just took classes - I was on track to have one major and three minors and in the end I dropped two minors because I just wanted to graduate. In the past few years I’ve come across triple major and quadruple major people so I assume that taking classes in different fields is even more common now.\n\nThat said, in the end I believe I chose the wrong major for me. I was fine studying it but didn’t love it - when I graduated with a capstone internship I didn’t want to continue to in the field, although my degree wasn’t a hindrance for my career afterward.\n\nThe same thing happened with my first master’s a few years ago - loved the field before going in, volunteered and interned and decided I wanted in, studied it - liked it but didn’t love it the same way my classmates did (but I really thought I liked it; turned out people could be a lot more passionate and I stood out in my cohort for not being that crazy about our field). I did a lot of projects during the degree and after my graduation internship I didn’t want to continue in the field.\n\nThen a few more years of work brought me to my second master’s at Harvard and I love it, and I didn’t think I would have loved the field this much.\n\nCareer-wise I’ve been in 5 unrelated industries throughout my working life and have done more than five different functions. I’ve had side hustles and I’ve had side “careers” purely for fun (I wrote a few novels. I had a blast and made less than a month’s salary lol and I took a lot of student jobs in the performance industry just for fun and they make interesting stories now - but no money).\n\nMy point is, maybe you won’t narrow down or decide per se. You might end up pursuing all your interests at the same time or consecutively - in college that’s pretty normal, and in career it might be less ideal depending on what you value (some people do value a more standard career and there’s nothing wrong with either option; sometimes I wonder too what would have happened if I found my industry earlier or went into a more popular option right out of the gate) but it happens and it’s perfectly fine too when it happens. I’m pretty successful at what I do even though I’ve hopped around; I don’t make a ton of money since my industry isn’t that well paid overall but I do make “a lot” for my industry and I’m comfortable, I believe it’s because after hopping around I did finally find things I’m good at + passionate enough about.\n\nI do have a few tips that I wish college me knew though:\n\n**1 - Challenge all your assumptions:**\n\nI pursued my major because I assumed my “conservative” parents wouldn’t agree to me studying humanities and I didn’t even know anyone who did humanities; and I thought it was a smart choice because “humanities don’t pay”.\n\nIn the end it turned out:  \n- my parents (who are not even conservative) didn’t give a damn what I studied at all but I didn’t communicate well with them; they totally thought I loved my major  \n- I was not the type of person that could bear a job I wasn’t 100% in love with; some people are fine with it, I happened to not be, and again nothing wrong with either but people are different  \n- humanities do pay if you know what you’re doing; there are careers that are major-agnostic and there are certainly well or at least okay-paying jobs in humanities fields  \n\n**2 - Decide what matters to you**\n\nBluntly put, some people don’t care what they do in a day job, some people do;  \nSome jobs don’t care what you studied, some jobs do;  \nSome people don’t really need to have a lucrative job, some people have to pay back loans, etc.\n\n**3 - Working in something and studying something is often different**\n\nTry out different jobs through internships & volunteer opportunities, talk to folks who are working, talk to your profs who’ve been in industry, network network network.\n\nAs a student you’re actually juggling deciding two things, what you study & what you’ll do as a job.\n\nSometimes these two aren’t even necessarily the same things but then you’ll need to prepare for both. (For example you can study history and in the end work in investment banking; but that means doing all the necessary steps as well outside of your major, such as learning financial modeling and getting the right summer internships from at the latest sophomore year.)\n\nDepending on your situation maybe one of these things (what to study & what career to pursue) is more important to you and you’ll need to prioritize that. I’ve come across a lot of students who prioritize what to study while not networking hard enough to figure out what they wanna do or to prepare for it. Networking is not just for extra extroverted people, it’s literally necessary imo just to find that options are out there and find out what they are like as much as possible.\n\nI’ve also seen some people who focus too much on what to do when they graduate and stress themselves out - I know undergrad at Harvard is probably a lot more intense than where I went to (also it was a different time) but try to have some fun with your classes too, especially requirements that you need to fill anyway. Not all classes have to immediately pertain to your future career either. I never ended up working in anything remotely related to physical anthropology but that one class I took in undergrad is still some fond memories for me. It opened my eyes to a new world and was fun.\n\n**4 - In the end with all your perfect planning things might not turn out as planned**\n\nAnd that’s ok. Frankly it’s just life.

1fovmnk,harvard,The problem with the Sasha the HUPD dog (Campus mascot police dog ),"As a dog at HUPD (yes, a proper trained bomb-sniffing dog), I have had it with the Sasha ""HUPD dog."" For those who don't know Sasha or the HUPD dog is a 3-year-old ""social support"" dog similar to Elvy at Brown or Coach at Princeton. These washed up soft-pawed unimpressive chumps bark like they actually belong when in reality there is almost nothing in common between them and the regular K-9s in anti-drug or bomb units who are very bright, motivated, and create an inspiring environment in campus PDs. And this is not just me, almost every dog whose butt I sniffed does not like Sasha.

To clarify, not including the proctor and tutor dogs, Remy the cat, CPD horse units and the raccoons that visit the Lehman Hall dumpsters, all of which are proper campus animals who are very capable. Sasha is the anomaly, the executive canine money maker for Harvard which features in a ton of uninspiring old selfiess each year.

At dog training schools, K9 student dogs are not an issue as they're either separated into their own classes and cohort, or they're few in number. However, at Harvard, Sasha is in events with regular students asking dumb questions and making droning monologues that are more emotion than substance. Let's be real, if they're not failing in their transformative experiences, they wouldn't be taking selfies with a washed-up auntie pup hag. Anyone normal who hears the cringe washed up auntie bark would probably want to blow their brains out. How can Harvard let Sasha be the canine face on campus when there are squirrels to be photographed everywhere? And whatever happened to the turkey suit mascot?

As I have been ranting, I feel the need to propose some solutions

1. Dramatically reduce the Sasha pictures and public appearances
2. Separate Sasha department. Let campus services have her and feed her HUDS leftovers.
3. Have Remy be the campus comfort animals.
4. Clearly label her 'for entertainment purposes only' and make a real dog like me the feature ","['It’s about time someone raised this issue.

Where is the Crimson on this important issue?

All of my friends have already graduated and everyone from my original class year is pretty much gone. I kind of feel like a freshman all over again, but instead of being in the yard where it feels like everyone is trying their hardest to get to know new people, I'm in a house where it seems like everyone already has a pretty solid network of friends and people they know.   
I'm trying to join some clubs at the moment, but I'm waiting on hearing back on comp/ applications. Ultimately, I just feel lost socially and am having a hard time figuring out what to do. ","[""Activities and extracurriculars are probably the way. People are constantly trying new things and meeting others for the first time as a result, regardless of academic year. Look for opportunities where you're spending a lot of time together, or forging bonds by fire -- for example, comping a process. Maybe join your House HoCo, where people tend to be pretty sociable. Take classes that involve problem sets, and find a study group. Seek out transfer students if possible. And talk to your House's housing coordinator, maybe see if they can move you (next semester or next year) into a rooming group where someone has left for study abroad or other reasons."", ""I was in the same boat as an undergrad at the college \\~10 years ago. I think the move is to structure the things that you have to do regardless like studying, classes, housing, eating at the dhall, etc. into opportunities to engage socially. Take classes with group projects or one with problem sets and form a study group. Join extracurriculars known for their social life. Join the HoCo or at least make an effort to consistently show up to house events and participate in house life like intramurals. Make it a point to schedule meals with people. Inevitably you'll still feel lonely sometimes as Harvard is set up for people to make their core friend/blocking group as a first-year but there are plenty of other people on campus looking to make friends as an upper classman. You'll also have a head start on learning the life skill of making friends and following up with people.""]",Top-Door-771,1727210509.0,7

1fnrq3g,harvard,Making the most out of being at Harvard College,"Settling into the realization that I will be here for another few years, I might as well take advantage of what I can. What are some of your recommendations on how to make the most out of being at the college?","['* Make a list of 1-5 things you legitimately might want to do in a future (PhD in X, join company Y, etc.) and work backwards from there to prioritize what really matters (from a career/post-grad POV).  Lots of stuff becomes unimportant when you realize it is truly disconnected from anything at the top of your list.\n\n* Periodically redo the above exercise--your top 5 or understanding of what matters may change.\n\n* Interview current students ahead of you, recent grads, and/or older alumni about their paths.  Use that to again check your prioritization list.\n\nIf the above sounds like a bunch of work...it isn\'t supposed to!  It is supposed to do the opposite--help you deal with rampant FOMO, because there are a bazillion possible time sucks, including for things that you think you *might* want (""well what if I *did* want to join McKinsey?"") but truly don\'t.\n\n* Clubs really don\'t matter that much, except 1) for very specific paths and 2) insofar as they are directly teaching you critical things.  Don\'t stress too much, and don\'t spend more time on them than you actually can rationalize.\n\n* Your specific coursework similarly doesn\'t matter for most pursuits.  This doesn\'t mean that learning doesn\'t matter, but rather than class X versus Y likely won\'t matter in 5 years, so don\'t stress if you can\'t fit in a specific course or second concentration or whatnot.  Exceptions to all of this, of course, for very specific paths like PhD in STEM fields.\n\n* Along those lines, figure out how much your GPA matters.  \n\nThis might sound a little odd, but going back to the ""top 5"" list--\n\nThere are a lot of paths where your GPA really doesn\'t matter (as long as it isn\'t awful).  But also a few where it really does (certain graduate programs, as limited # of high-end career options, etc.).  \n\nIf you\'re gunning for a path where that ~4.0 really does make a difference...have at it.\n\nIf you\'re not (and be honest with yourself), 1) relax a little and 2) put your energies elsewhere.\n\nKnow/learn what you need to do.\n\n* Summer internships are great, both from a career POV (crucial for resume) and for getting you outside of the Harvard bubble.  Understand how the application processes work, and treat it like a priority activity.  Success (first internship) begets success (more options for second) here.\n\n(This doesn\'t mean that if you don\'t get your dream internship you\'re hosed!  Just each step is marginally easier, if you\'re thoughtful in building a path forward.)\n\n* Go into Boston occasionally.  Even if just to walk around with friends.\n\n* Exercise. Lift weights.  Maybe start a martial art like BJJ.\n\n* Lastly, run the same ""top 5"" exercise for things that you actually enjoy and/or help you recover.  Give bonus points for things which get you mixing with your classmates.', 'Make good friends.  Harvard alums are good to know.  They seem normal now but many of them will go on to do great things.  Like Conan O’Brien, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, Tom Morelli, Yo Yo Ma…', 'I’m going to approach this completely differently than the other comment here, just to give another perspective (though their advice is actually also great). While many strategies focus on building a long-term career through goal setting and prioritization, I think there’s a more holistic approach to enjoying college life without feeling like you’re sacrificing your future.\n\n1. Focus on Exploration, Not Just Optimization\nCollege is one of the few times in life when you’re surrounded by a huge variety of people, ideas, and activities. By stepping outside of a hyper-focused path, you might stumble upon something you’re passionate about, even if it doesn’t align with pre-set goals. A flexible, exploratory mindset may still lead to career success, but it also creates room for serendipity. (I stumbled into my current career path because of this)\n\n2. Enjoy the People and Build Relationships, Not Just Networks\nNetworking is important, but don’t approach every relationship with a career-oriented lens. Instead, enjoy genuine connections with people because those are the relationships that often end up shaping your life. Career networks are fine, but the friends who stick by you through the highs and lows will be just as—if not more—important.\n\n3. Balance Achievement with Personal Fulfillment\nI’d say focus on doing things that make me happy and fulfilled—whether that’s joining a fun club, pursuing a hobby, or taking classes purely for interest. Sure, academics and career goals matter, but finding activities that give you joy and balance out the stress is what makes college a memorable experience.\n\n4. Use Mistakes as Learning Opportunities, Not Career Setbacks\nMany stress over GPA, internships, and getting everything “right.” But I think it’s more productive to embrace mistakes as learning experiences rather than career-destroying failures. It’s in those moments where you find personal growth, and that can build resilience for your future career. Nobody cares if your (massively inflated) GPA has a handful of non-A’s on it. But being able to speak candidly about your growth in your ability to handle increasingly complex material, your past failures and subsequent growths will pay dividends in your life. \n\n5. Career Can Wait; Experiences Can’t\nA job or a career path can be pursued at any point in life. But this moment, surrounded by a unique environment with access to resources, people, and freedom to explore? That’s limited to now. If you can, try to travel, attend events, and engage with people beyond just my field of study because those are experiences you can’t replicate later. \n\n6. Physical and Mental Health Over Resume Building\nExercise, sleep, and mental well-being should come first. Burning out in the name of career preparation isn’t going to pay off in the long run. Building a healthier lifestyle now will benefit your future success far more than a perfect resume will.\n\nIn short, my approach is to prioritize personal growth, meaningful connections, and life experiences over a rigid focus on career optimization. That way, I’ll leave college with not just a diploma, but a set of rich memories and a fuller understanding of myself and the world around me.', 'Speaking in part from my mistakes—it’s an incredible experience, make the most of it:\n\n1) Be social—join clubs, hang out with your roommates/floormates, etc.  The best part of the Harvard experience is the people you meet.  Try not to eat alone (okay to break this rule occasionally if you’re an introvert).\n\n2) Take a couple out-there classes in a subject that’s totally new to you (make sure the professor/Q scores are good first though).  You’ll probably never have as much latitude to explore new things academically the rest of your life (possibly unless you become an academic yourself).  Philosophy of religion was a cool one for me—nothing to do with my concentration or my current professional life, but made a huge impact on my outlook on life.  Plus a great class on the politics of Shakespeare after not really enjoying Shakespeare in high school English classes.\n\n3) Take advantage of the libraries.  Widener in particular has one of the biggest and most diverse collections in the country (probably the world).  They’re not just great places to study, you can find books on basically anything you’re interested in.  (The Coop is also cool.)\n\n4) Don’t forget about your health.  Avoid pigging out at the dining hall, take advantage of the gyms and (weather permitting) the nice places around you to run (including along the Charles River).  Go on long walks in Cambridge (it’s especially beautiful in the fall).\n\n5) Work hard at your classes, and actively seek help from your classmates, professors, or TAs.  Again, the people around you are the best part of the experience.  Learn from them.\n\n6) Go to the Harvard-Yale football games (especially the home games).  It doesn’t matter if you like football/sports in general, it’s just a big party for your whole class.\n\n7) Make plans with your friends to go into Boston once in a while.  Go to Fenway, the Boston Symphony, the North End (my favorite), Chinatown, whatever.  There’s a lot to do, and it’s really easy to forget about it.', ""I miss the dining halls, common rooms, and libraries SO much.  Just soak it all in as much as you can.  I wish I could sit and read in the Leverett House library, Kirkland House library, Cabot dining hall along the huge window with the sunlight.  There are just so many amazing spaces.\n\nBut I'd really lean into just bonding with your friends and perhaps even making new social ties.  I agree with a lot of the other advice about club activity.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Oh, do IM crew if that's something you could see yourself doing!

1flfl2d,harvard,"When someone asks where you went to school, and you say ""Harvard"" but the person meant ""high school"": other cringe-worthy moments?","Decades after graduating from Harvard, I've finally moved on from the advice to respond ""Massachusetts"" or ""the Boston area"" when people ask me where I went to school.

1fmejho,harvard,The problem with the MC/MPA Program (Mid-career MPA),"As a student at HKS (yes, a proper 2 year degree student), I have had it with the MC/MPA ""students."" For those who don't know MC/MPA or Mid-Career MPA is a 1-year ""executive"" program similar to executive MBAs at business schools. These washed up 40+ year old unimpressive chumps think they actually belong when in reality there is almost nothing in common between them and the regular 2-year and PhD students who are very bright, motivated, and create an inspiring environment at HKS. And this is not just me, almost every 2-year student I've spoken to do not speak well of MC/MPAs.

To clarify, not including the PhD, HKS has three 2-year degrees, MPP, MPA, and MPA/ID, all of which have proper students who are very capable. The MC/MPA is the anomaly, the executive degree money maker for HKS which brings in a ton of uninspiring old wannabes each year.

At business schools, executive students are not an issue as they're either separated into their own classes and cohort, or they're few in number. However, at HKS, they're in class with regular students and dilute our experience by asking dumb questions and making droning monologues that are more emotion than substance. Let's be real, if they're not failing in their careers, they wouldn't be leaving their jobs at 40-50 years old.

There are countless moments that show the level of stupidity of these Mid-careers that I just couldn't believe Harvard actually allows them to carry degrees.

This current Kennedy School Student Government election cycle is another demonstration of this stupidity. Anyone normal who hears the current MC/MPA candidate (cringe washed up auntie) speak would probably want to blow their brains out. How can HKS let MC/MPAs run for student body president when they're here for only a year and couldn't be more disconnected from the core student body. The HKS Whatsapp group is also inflamed right now because of dumb arguments raised by MC/MPAs on data privacy to smear other candidates. Complete shit show.

As I have been ranting, I feel the need to propose some solutions

1. Dramatically reduce the class size of MC/MPAs and increase admissions standards
2. Separate MC/MPA classes. Let them have their own classroom experience with fellow 40+ year olds
3. Have them maintain their own student government
4. Clearly label their degrees as ""Executive MPAs"" so they don't pretend to be regular 2-years","['Funny thing is, it’s the exact same degree a 2 year MPA gets. Executive ed is nowhere on it.

Like the adorned shield, I have nothing negative to say about HLS.\n* SPH and HBS have similar qualities. They're both clean and instantly recognizable. The color balances both feel a tad heavy on the white but it's not a big deal. The crosses and their respective decorations look great. However, the outlines & border for HBS are much thicker than for any other shield, and I think it's too much. So HBS goes below SPH.\n\nA-tier:\n\n* HDS: I'm a sucker for chevrons and this one has the perfect thickness and placement. The holly sprigs and wood pigeons fill out the space decently, but also make it feel a bit crowded and messy. The pigeons also make the color balance feel a bit too white.\n* SEAS doesn't look too great in this image but it's just because of the dark background of the image. When the shield is placed on a lighter background it [looks much better](https://imgur.com/a/AK9hBJ9). The chain stitch is a nice detail. The ragged cross isn't particularly alluring but it does strike a good balance between being too plain and being too noisy.\n* College: The chevron on this one is good, but it feels a bit thin. There's some open space to the left & right of the chevron but it's not a big deal. Looks great overall.\n* HMS is cool at first glance, but if you look closely, the lion looks kind of weird and deformed. If it were the [lion on the wikipedia page](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Harvard_Medical_School.svg/1657px-Harvard_Medical_School.svg.png) that I linked above, HMS would be S-tier.\n\nB-tier:\n\n* Veritas / FAS: Bread and butter. It's the ubiquitous base design and it's a tad plain, but still good.\n* GSAS is fairly plain. The white stripe doesn't add anything to the base Veritas shield, it just makes the shield feel too horizontal.\n* Dental: Among the shields that have the ᴠᴇʀɪᴛᴀꜱ chief at the top, this one is the most boring. Also the rectangular shape of the castle doesn't fill out the space well.\n* HGSE would possibly be in A-tier, but closer inspection reveals that (1) the two black flowers aren't vertically aligned, (2) the steps aren't all the same length, and (3) the steps have a weird diagonal lip at the top left. These all greatly annoy me.\n\nC-tier:\n\n* HES is wider & rounder than the rest of the shields which IMO looks worse. The chevron is too low and too thin, and it's at 42° angles unlike the 45° angles of the chevrons for HDS and College, which annoys me. The chief is not distinctly separated enough from the rest of the shield. The lamp and the bushels of wheat are okay though.\n* GSD looks awful. It's just way too messy. It's an eyesore.\n* HKS is somehow both too noisy *and* too bland. At least GSD *tried* to do something unique, this one is just a bunch of thin stripes and it looks terrible. Also the stripes become way too small at the bottom due to the shape of the shield.\n* Radcliffe just looks bad. The two black stripes are not enough decoration for a shield with no other details. The orange border feels too thick and I dislike that shade of orange, it feels too vibrant. Importantly, this shield is missing the black outlines and borders present in every other shield. I made a [quick edit](https://imgur.com/a/ymLEAln) of what this shield would look like with outlines and IMO it looks much better.

I've liked this person since the moment I saw them. Let's name them X. X is not only my type, but might be the most 'good' person I've ever met. They aren't afraid to be vulnerable and stick to their morals. 

I definitely wasn't thinking about asking out X anytime soon. I'm a freshman, so there's that whole power difference, adjusting and making friends thing. I also want time to sort out my feelings. Perhaps worst of all, they literally live right next to me. X's friend group (and now my friends) also live on the same section of the floor, and I really, really like everyone in the group. 

X hasn't dated before, and have indicated that they're open to dating. But because X is literally just too cool, they have cool friends, particularly one called Y. (If I were of a different sexual orientation, I would've totally had a crush on Y.) X's eyes light up whenever Y's name is mentioned, and they really are something of best friends. I could see them getting together, and I would be so happy for them and find them cute but feel sad and bitter inside at the same time.

If I don't ask out X, I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life. The question is to wait how long. I was thinking about, at earliest, spring semester, and ideally, when I'm a sophomore. I won't be able to see X over the summer.

1fv0ejg,mit,I was an idiot in some Mathematics class ,"Hello everybody. 

My pardon for intruding, but just to get things out there I did not attend MIT as a student. While I say I did not attend, I did in fact show up for a class at MIT. I went to Boston University, just across the river and was given a ""challenge"" so to speak to attend any possible MIT class and either answer or ask a question in dumb fashion. 

My friend and I both showed up on general campus and began asking around what's the earliest class that's about to happen. We were led to a large lecture hall that was to be held for an advanced mathematics class of some sort. 

Upon the class beginning, my friend was planted near center of the hall while I was to the far right, closest to the door. I was originally supposed to be the one to ask whatever question, but my anxiety got the best of me. I signaled to my friend what was happening and he stepped in. 

He essentially asked to translate common math symbols on the board to English. Y'all went/go to MIT, I don't feel the need to explain this one. I do have this on video. 

Immediately after he asked his question, he left the room leaving just me. Watching the courage reign through no matter the embarrassment on his end was inspiring to me, so I ended up asking my original ""idiotic"" question.

This is an exact word for word on what happened:

Me: \*Raises hand\* keep in mind, I'm on the far right side of the hall. It is harder for the prof to see me. Someone maybe 8 seats down sees me and signals to the professor to call on me. 

\*Teacher points to me\* 

here we go folks

Me: ""I know this is a strange question, but what college is this by any chance?""

Prof: ""I'm sorry???""

Me: ""What college are we currently at?""

Prof: ""Ummmmmmmmmmmmm the Massachusetts Institute of Technology?""

Me: \*While prof utters the college, I slowly begin to lift from my chair\*

Me: ""Oh fuck, wrong school!"" I immediately run from my seat through the doors, leaving a laughing classroom behind. 

To this day I always think about it since I got my friend's question on film, but never mine (and mine was def funnier). 

Is there by any chance someone from that class may have caught it on film?????? I know I'm throwing a reel into a large sea here, but maybe there is hope out there. 

Roast me as much as you'd like, I probably deserve it. ","[""I'm curious, is this challenge annual?

Please look into starting salaries after graduation for MIT undergraduates. Adjust based on your anticipated field, YMMV.\n3. There is considerable aid for a wide range of incomes. I found my offer from MIT included more aid at the time than other less-expensive institutions and had a lower net cost. I have heard similarly for a range of other people, but YMMV\n4. With all postsecondary colleges and universities, there is a value to the experience, there is also a cost to attend. Both variables vary from institution to institution and include many intangibles. So if the value of the tangibles and intangibles exceeds the cost, you are likely to apply.', 'If you’ve saved nothing and have no ability to work, you’re not UMC. You’re… non-working working poor? \xa0\n\nBig difference going for a lucrative degree (CS) vs non (urban planning).

If they didn’t, or if they’re unwilling to help pay, you’re in a tight spot and would probably need loans. $120k is truly a lot of money, so I’d suggest talking to your parents and applying to financial safeties (so probably schools that would give you a big scholarship/merit aid) as well as your top schools, in case you can’t get it to work out.', 'MIT is one of less than 10 colleges in the US that is need blind (ability to pay is not considered as part of admissions) and full need (meaning that 100% of demonstrated financial need is covered with aid) for US applicants.\n\n“I could’ve gotten into MIT but they didn’t give me an offer because I asked for financial aid,” is something that no MIT applicant will ever have to say.\n\n“I got into MIT but didn’t go because my family couldn’t afford it,” is something that no MIT admit will ever have to say.\n\n“I didn’t bother applying to MIT because I didn’t think my family could afford it,” is something that only the misinformed would say.', 'Although many MIT admits could probably find some other options with huge merit scholarships if they are willing to be flexible about location, etc., $30K is about the in-state cost of a state flagship in higher cost of living states.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that about $20K of that is basically just room and board. You can likely shave some off of that by living in a cook for yourself dorm. \n\nIf you are upper middle class, it seems surprising that your family would pay that with 100% loans…no savings? no ability to cash flow any of it? \n\nWere your parents paying for things for you in high school?\n\nMIT also offers an installment payment plan so you don’t have to come up with $30K immediately in August.\n\nThat’s even before getting to the student’s ability to work, during term-time and over the summer.

1fipkjh,mit,Thought on MIT's Alumni Career Design Fellowship program?,"[https://www.missioncollaborative.com/mitfellowship](https://www.missioncollaborative.com/mitfellowship)

Hi everyone! Life has been messy recently. 

I graduated in 2021 with a BS in mechanical engineering (2A). I have been feeling pretty lost in the past three years since I have never truly enjoyed any of my jobs. I have recently been thinking that maybe I chose the wrong major, since I seem to like more the coding part of my projects. I have been wondering if  instead of product design (which is what I've done for most of my roles ), I should have focused in another mechanical engineering area, like  robotics. Or a completely different major, like CS. 

Furthernmore, I also had to leave the US in July (I was an international student who after 3 years of OPT didn't get the lottery visa), and so now I not only have to find a job but also restart my whole life. Anyways, it has been some very hard months and I feel super lost and money is running out. So I saw this program and thought it might help... has anyone done it or know about anyone who did it? I want to know if it is actually worth it. Thanks! ","[""This is a program that paid money to be advertised via the MIT Alumni website. Do a search for that name, you'll find ads targeting alumni of many schools. \n\nIf your life has been messy, maybe you need peesonal coaching help. I don't know if a career design program is going to help. I don't even know what a career design program is. \n\nGood luck."", ""No idea about the program, but do a reverse image search on the headshots in the testimonials they use on the website and you'll see that they are fake. I would tread carefully."", 'I\'ll be honest, this seems like one of those ""pay me for personal coaching"" MLM-type of programs.', ""I did this program and can relate to you: 2A w/product design, but enjoyed coding projects the most. After a number of years not enjoying my job and feeling stuck, decided to try this because I wasn’t making progress (out of laziness or fear, who knows) and hoped it would lead to some accountability at the very minimum. It did seem a bit weird that this is a 3rd-party program that runs at many universities. Good business model for the people running it I suppose.\n\nMy #1 goal entering the program was not necessarily to find a new career, but to make new connections with alumni. I liked the idea of regular meetings with a peer group that might lead to deeper conversation, camaraderie, and support beyond the program.\n\nThe content itself is nothing new. All self-help and career building is kinda the same, the coaching mindset is “the answers are within you, here is some work you should do to find them”. You have some reading each week and an assignment. The major difference with this program is the accountability you have with your peer group in presenting your thoughts/progress each week. It also sounds obvious but the course material is very career focused and I appreciated having some structured “worksheets” to get through, and discussing with others. It helped me get comfortable with storytelling my career and thinking about next steps.\n\nAlthough the program is over, I still keep in touch with my peer group regularly. I also reconnected with an old classmate who has become a great friend. I personally did not change careers, but 2/4 of my peer group did get new jobs. Was it worth it? For me, yes, but may not be for you if you are more disciplined than I, funds are super tight, or you've stayed connected w/alumni. I'd suggest getting a group of friends together,  working through a book like Design Your Life, or having a conversation with ChatGPT and ask it to act as a coach (I know there's a disclaimer not to use it as a therapist but honestly it's been helpful in bringing clarity to my thoughts...). A therapist is helpful to tackle self-worth and self-confidence if that's holding you back. You will make it through. Happy to chat more over DM."", 'Nah']",SeggsyLlama,1726546261.0,11

The Caltrain rail is nice although sometimes terribly inconvenient/slow. \n\n* Vehicle traffic is terrible. Biking is very popular but can be dangerous.

It\'s not cheap, but it\'s reasonable for what you get, which is an incredibly convenient, safe, and friendly community with *relatively* good management. As mentioned, there are many medical professionals there. As an example, at the time we left in 2020, we had a BMT attending on one side of us, an RT on the other, a peds hospitalist across the path, and a neurosurg attending next to them. It is particularly great for families with small children (e.g. multiple pools, multiple playgrounds, on-site daycare, large field, ~8 min walk to a huge shopping mall, occasional community events aimed at kids).

The time for a ceasefire was a long time ago, I’m extremely opposed to Bibi and his government, and I’m fiercely against the settlements in the West Bank. So Please don't act like I'm some right-wing zionist extremist because I'm not.

Exactly one year ago on October 7, 2023, the largest killing of Jews since the Holocaust occured. About 1200 people were killed by Hamas and about 250 were kidnapped. People were raped, people were burned alive... you get the idea. It was not an act of resistance, it was an indiscriminate act of terrorism.

My question is, out of literally any other day of the year, why are people choosing today to go out and protest? I understand that most of the protesters do not condone the actions of Hamas. However, SJP has demonstrated that they're willing to give defense for Hamas. The national SJP had explicitly called Hamas a ""progressive organization"" on its website. UCLA SJP had posted a direct quote from a Hamas higher-up and has also called for the full destruction of Israel. UCLA SJP posted about today's protest on their Instagram, so I'd assume they had at least some involvement.

Even if we assume that none of the protesters condone the actions of Hamas, does optics simply not exist? Between today's date and the SJP involvement, I fail to see how this won't appear as a celebration of Hamas to many people.

","David Baker, a professor at the University of Washington, is one of three winners of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, announced this morning. **Baker received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in 1989.**

*Baker ""completed his doctorate in biochemistry at the* [*University of California, Berkeley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley) *in 1989 in the laboratory of* [*Randy Schekman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman)*, where he worked predominantly on protein transport and trafficking in* [*yeast*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast)*. In 1993, he completed his postdoctoral training in biophysics with* [*David Agard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Agard) *at the* [*University of California, San Francisco*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco)*.* 

*Baker joined the Department of Biochemistry at the* [*University of Washington School of Medicine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington_School_of_Medicine) *as faculty in 1993.""  (Wikipedia)*

Adding that Professor Schekman won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013. 

Baker's co-winners this year are Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, both of whom are based in London and currently work for Google DeepMind.  Baker receives 1/2 of the prize money and the other two 1/4 each. 

So, the streak of close-but-not-close-enough continues with UC Berkeley and the Nobel Prize this year. **Of the prizes announced so far--Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry--one recipient of each prize has a direct Berkeley connection, but none of the three were on the Berkeley faculty when they won the prize.** 

Interestingly of the three Berkeley-related winners, one received his undergraduate degree at Cal, one received his Ph.D. here, and the third was an Assistant, then Associate, professor here. 

","['Bring back the seal', 'Awesome to see Baker honored, his lab consistently puts out the most amazing work and his grad students and undergrad researchers have been able to create some amazing work and come back to Cal as grad students or more.

The Berkeley community should be very proud of being a critical part of nurturing and developing these world-changing minds.', ""The AI/ML connection is really interesting this year, isn't it? Both the Medicine and Chemistry prizes seemed to emphasize research in fields associated with AI. I came across an article that said that Baker's two co-winners today, the Google researchers in England, had been mentioned in recent years as possible Nobel candidates, but many experts felt it's too early, and AI isn't fully established enough to merit Nobel recognition as a lasting breakthrough in science. But clearly, this week, the Nobel committees disagreed.\n\nSo maybe the Nobel awards this year are now being run by AI. :-)  Watching the award ceremonies, there are three individuals announcing each award, and they all look sort of generic and are positioned to sit behind a table so you can't see their legs or their hands.

No matter what side you’re on, signs like these are extremely insensitive and dehumanizing to Jewish people and communities. Framing the horrors and violence of October 7th as a day of “resistance” or a “celebration” is completely unacceptable and will only cause pro-Palestine groups to lose support. You can still advocate for Palestinian aid and liberation without terrorizing Jewish communities who are trying to mourn. We all have our own unique backgrounds and political views - everyone deserves to feel safe and secure at their own school.

Tech jobs are drying up and graduates are no longer guaranteed a role.** \n\n*As told to Beatrice Nolan Oct 4, 2024, 11:12 AM UTC*\n\n* James O\'Brien is a UC Berkeley professor who says tech graduates struggle to secure top jobs.\n\n* He says AI and outsourcing are affecting entry-level tech positions.\n\n* O\'Brien says we need to embrace universal basic income as AI shrinks the job market. \n\n*This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with James O\'Brien, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The following has been edited for length and clarity.*\n\nI\'ve been a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley since 2000.\n\nRecently, I\'ve noticed how difficult it is for tech graduates to enter the job market right now.\n\nAt least in technology, it\'s a very different landscape than it has been in the past. It\'s not just my students; it\'s a hard time for everyone right now.\n\nOver the years, students I\'ve worked with, taught, or known from other schools have typically had little trouble finding a job after graduating with a tech degree.\n\nThere were lots of opportunities. Quite often, recent graduates would receive multiple offers and be left to try to decide between two really great choices.\n\nBut now, things have changed. There\'s still demand for people, and some people are getting jobs, but not across the entire industry. Our view from Berkeley is also a little distorted because we\'re one of the top schools, so most of our students are still getting offers.\n\nBut rather than getting five great offers, they might only get one great offer or an offer from their second choice. This is certainly not what we\'ve seen in the past.\n\nThere are also people coming from other schools that don\'t have quite the strong reputation that Berkeley does, and they\'re not getting job offers at all.\n\n**Some programming roles are disappearing**\n\nIt\'s not just the technology jobs that are being affected.\n\nAny ""hands-on keyboard job"" is at risk of being contracted out offshore or outsourced to AI.\n\nAnother problem is that many companies are also trying to consolidate a bit. These things are all coming together like a perfect storm.\n\nIn tech, programming positions that aren\'t that demanding are disappearing. You can now use a programming assistant that\'s based on a large language model to basically write a lot of code for you. So, where a company would have had to hire one or two people before, they no longer need to.\n\nThey are still entry-level jobs that involve basically babysitting the AI — but these systems are getting better very quickly.\n\nCertain specializations like CS-AI or data science still seem in high demand, but I\'m concerned that this may not last.\n\nThe job market is still shrinking, and I think that may accelerate over the next few years. It\'s definitely something we\'ve seen over the last two to three years, but this last year, it has accelerated.\nStudents are aware that the job market is changing, and many of them are considering specializing in AI or data science because they want to take advantage of this new situation.\n\n**We need to accept the idea of universal basic income**\n\nIt\'s tempting to say we\'ll somehow protect the jobs and prevent them from disappearing, but I don\'t know how successful that would be.\n\nIf a technology exists for doing something faster, better, and more efficiently, it\'s very hard to tell someone not to use that. We can\'t demand companies spend a lot more money and do it more slowly with a human person.\n\nThat approach would stifle innovation and business.\n\nI think we need to accept the idea of paying people a universal basic income — a system that gives people a basic amount of support that\'s not contingent on anything. That way if you get a job, you still get that basic support. But if you don\'t get a job, you still have support.\n\nI can understand when people have issues with UBI and question why the results of their work should be given to someone else.\n\nBut if machines are doing the work instead of us, then it\'s a different formula. Instead of taxing people, we would be able to tax the work done by machines or AI automation and use that to provide a basic level of income.', 'CS majors shouldn’t give up. They should realize that they need to be exceptional to get a job, and should work harder to be exceptional. It’s not impossible, it just takes hard work.\n\nFor exceptional CS majors, the job market is booming, with tons of opportunities everywhere.', ""Just being pragmatic: Trader Joes or Whole Foods jobs pay the rent and have good Glassdoor ratings...if you have a bf/gf or roomie.  When the AI infrastructure gets built up a bit more, and interest rates drop a bit more, DS jobs will come back...not CS: over-supply from layoffs, outsourcing.

This was after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.\n\nHere\'s the announcement of the program, from 1997. [https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors/berdahl/speeches/SAFER-program-announcement](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors/berdahl/speeches/SAFER-program-announcement)  \n\nI couldn\'t find a link to a current update, but I would imagine one is out there somewhere. \n\nThe work has now been ongoing for nearly a quarter century. Every campus building and off-campus UC owned building was evaluated, they were all rated as to hazards, and a plan put in place to either retrofit or demolish them one by one.  I don\'t think it is quite done yet, but scores of buildings (including all the residence halls, and most academic buildings on campus) have been upgraded and repaired. Usually the retrofit work was combined with other upgrades / improvements to buildings. \n\nThe program was not to ensure that the buildings would be fully useable right after a major earthquake, but to reduce life-threatening hazards (like a building collapsing, or parts of it falling on people). \n\nOff campus, in the City of Berkeley, the City has had a program for years to reduce hazards of ""soft story"" or unreinforced masonry buildings. Unreinforced masonry is basically brick or concrete buildings without sufficient strengthening to survive a major earthquake; fortunately, there are not that many of those in Berkeley, and most have been strengthened. ""Soft story"" buildings were often built in the 1950s through the 1970s, and included a lot of apartment buildings that had parking garages under the building near, or at, street level. I think most of those have been earthquake retrofit as well.\n\nThere\'s not, so far as I know, a specific set of City programs on reinforcing older wood-frame buildings, but the good news there is that smaller wood frame buildings, like Berkeley\'s older houses, are fairly resistant to earthquake shaking as long as they have newer, or repaired, foundations. (The State of California does have foundation reinforcement programs for homeowners and apartment building owners). \n\nNone of this is to say that there won\'t be major damage in Berkeley from a major earthquake nearby. There will be. \n\nBut a lot has been done in the past three to four decades to reduce the risks, particularly of building collapse.', '3.1 magnitude eq localized in the RSF bathroom after eating 2 double XL chalupas from taco bell', 'I’d say the 1989 one.

1fyuk71,berkeley,Regret not going to Berkeley ,"As a transfer student who got into ucla and cal for civil engineering, I really do regret not going here and I feel like it chopped all of my motivation to do well in school. I chose ucla for simple reasons; I was really close to my family, (15 min without traffic) my girlfriend didn’t apply to Berkeley so we couldn’t have went here together, and lastly, for my major, the projected income difference between ucla and Berkeley was very negligible (5k more for Berkeley? I don’t remember, but they both line up to be the same after a couple of years) and it just felt like a safer school since it felt like I was making less sacrifices.  It’s been 2 weeks since the quarter started and it feels like the classes here seem weak; professors are not that good at teaching and no one really seems too interested in the subject or classes. This might sound a little dumb but I wanted an experience where I would face some sort of impostor syndrome where I would be astonished by the strength and dedication of my peers but I don’t feel this at ucla at all, it seems like most people are here to have fun and I realized this is not for me. and ucla gets upmost praise for its atmosphere but as someone who is doing engineering I never enjoyed the party style it has and find 0 appeal in it. I understand that I have my parents and my girlfriend very close to me now, which I am undoubtably grateful for, but often I imagine how different my life could have went if I just stuck with Berkeley since fafsa wasn’t really an issue to me (very low income). I could have seen myself doing long distance and then coming over to see my parents and my girlfriend frequently. If long distance failed, then I could have just said it was never meant to be and move on. Why am I posting this? I don’t know. I guess I might be looking for some sort of reassurance that in the end, for my major at least, and while berkeleys engineering is undoubtedly superior, it wouldn’t make a big difference to me career wise since I am not planning on pursuing a masters.

Sure, plenty of alumni in the area, but we're lucky if they show up to two of our events before vanishing from our radar. Covid really killed our momentum in terms of growth and engagement. But we're still around, putting on events in your communities. They might not get posted on the CAA website, but they'll go out in email newsletters or get posted to Facebook.

The newsletter put out by my department rarely features prior undergrads and when it does, it seems to be based on them maintaining a strong connection to an existing faculty member (my own advisor has since left for an ivy league school on the east coast).

Annual Berkeley Gala where the chancellor, vice chancellor, VIP and standout students (HK Olympians, Golden Overtones, Oski, etc. fly out to attend). Monthly Happy Hours/Networking, often with other T25 US Universities + Oxbridge. Very few casual events - when the football team is good they may have viewing parties. Facebook and email are main communcation.\n\n- Shanghai - apparently people (both job recruiters and also people faking being Berkeley grads) keep trying to infiltrate the WeChat group chats and pose as Berkeley grads. Lots and lots and lots of industry centric networking events. Regular Happy Hours, but very little attempts to connect with anyone, just a bunch of people looking to move up and gain a bigger group of contacts. About a decade ago, had more young alum, social events. Share the big events title (Berkeley Gala) with Hong Kong. There's at least 4 diffferent wechat groups that I'm a member of through the Shanghai alumni association\n\n- Houston - small and at the time I lived in Houston, only occasionally active - did some high school recruiting for Berkeley at the very big high school college fairs\n\n- Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley - super super active.

1fywsg0,berkeley,Berkeley-related Nobel Prizes: October 8. 2024 update (a long-time-ago Berkeley connection for one of the Physics Nobelists),"Well, the **Nobel Prize in Physics** was announced at 2:45 AM, Berkeley time today. I happened to be up (wasn't sleeping well because of the lingering hot weather) so I watched. The Prize was awarded to two winners, Geoffrey Hinton and **John Hopfield**, *""for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.""*

Hinton, who is currently on the faculty at the University of Toronto, is most notable for his work on AI and, most recently, his public warnings and concerns about the risks of AI.

Hopfield is currently age 91, and emeritus faculty at Princeton University, so this goes down formally as another Nobel for Princeton (and U.Toronto).

**He does have a UC Berkeley connection in his past, though**. **He was on the faculty in Physics at Berkeley from 1961-**6~~3~~ **64**, as both an Assistant and an Associate Professor, so was moving up the academic ladder. He would have been in his late '20s, then.

The sequence of his academic life seems to have been: Bachelors from Swarthmore, Ph.D. (Physics) from Cornell, two years at Bell Laboratories, a year or so at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, then (according to Wikipedia) *""subsequently a faculty member at University of California, Berkeley""*, then Princeton, then CalTech, then a return to Princeton.

The Berkeley connection is nice, but if we want to avoid TOO tangentially claiming association with a Nobel (and, from my perspective, that's the best path) he is not really a ""Berkeley Nobelist"". He wasn't on the Berkeley faculty when he won the award, and he's not a Berkeley alumnus, and he has several other distinguished academic / research appointments in his past.

The Princeton connection in particular is interesting because he writes in an autobiographical essay (linked at his Wikipedia page) that a particular line of research he was pursuing during his first period there came to what seemed like a dead end, and it sounds like he and the Physics department there agreed it would be best if he left Princeton. Thus his time at Caltech, but then eventually a return to Princeton with a faculty appointment in Molecular Biology. Lucky university!  They already feature him at the top of their webpage, in less than an hour after the award was announced. Quick work by their public relations staff.

**So. in summary, Berkeley contributed to Hopfield's academic career as a faculty member / researcher, but he was only on the faculty here for a few years, early in his long career.**

Princeton, by the way, claims as Nobelists:  *""Faculty, students and staff listed here performed their award-winning work at Princeton, were employed by or studying at Princeton when they received their award, or are currently working at the University. Alumni recipients are denoted in italics. An asterisk is used to denote graduate alumni.""* [*https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/honors-awards*](https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/honors-awards)

Hopefully we'll hear more about Hopfield's Berkeley connection later.

1fzaseb,berkeley,Ac transit confusion,"Hi! So is it me or has the ac transit system (or at least the 51b) not been doing great lately?

I'm talking very late buses, buses that completely skip you or anything like that. It's been a big problem for me lately and It's really wierd because I thought the transit system was great last year.

Today I got on the 51B in Elmwood to get to class. I got on and the bus just sat there. I thought it would be fine but we ended up sitting there for 16 minutes and not moving. We tried asking the driver what happened but he wouldn't say anything. He even asked someone if they needed medical help even though they were just calmly sitting there? I ended up late to class and only made it at all because someone on the bus happened to have their car parked nearby and offered to give me a ride.

That class ended up getting cancelled so i got on a different bus back home but we passed by that same 51b stop and the bus was still there 30 minutes later. I have no idea what that was about. 

My point is the ac transit system has been annoying for me lately and I'm just wondering if anybody else feels the same.

Berkeley is one of the largest public universities in America. Our Courses are big. Our Sections are Big. And Our Brains are big.

However, it can be hard dealing with so much success. In such large classes, it can be hard to make friends and feel connected. 

That is why [speakiez.com](https://speakiez.com/auth/register) was made. Where only students with a [berkeley.edu](http://berkeley.edu) email can join.

Speakiez is a website where students can input their course schedule (lectures, discussion sections, etc.). Basically for every course there is a dedicated server/chatroom where you can talk with everyone in your class called Lecture. Then there is a dedicated server/chatroom where you can talk with everyone in your discussion section, this is called Section. You can also create text channels limited to a certain number of people as well for any topics you want to talk about. You can talk about having roommates who really like football, or roommates who really hate football!

The goal is for Speakiez to be used during the lecture or discussion section. On the side of everyone’s laptop is a website that allows you to chat with everyone in that room. Ask questions anonymously to a TA, or chat with other students during the 10 minute wait until Berkeley Time hits.

Ask Questions, Provide Insights, Post Memes. Whatever you want.

**Remember to exercise caution when looking for housing.** Lots of scammers out there. Check their main profiles if on facebook to see if they match the user who reached out to you. See if you can verify them anywhere else that they actually live in the area. Beware of people pushing you to send deposit money without showing you the place. Please refer to the PDF survival guide located at the top of the post. It can save you money and just as importantly time, not having waste time and effort to interact with scammers. Most instances of people telling you to message them as replies to your posts on facebook are scams. Make sure they have listings on the group, not just replies to people looking as comments like that can't be screened. Most legit people will contact you first and have a listing already in the group.


**Fall sublets will be uncommon.** Most of the Winter sublets you've seen posted are people who failed to find a Fall-only sublet and are trying to recoup some of the un-used lease remaining. Be especially wary when searching for Fall-only sublets. Scammers count on people being desperate to bypass their warning senses. Some apartment complexes like Woodbury Gardens(2-15 and 21 month), and the complexes owned by Village Green(6 and 9 month) may offer shorter lease terms than 12 month. Be aware the shorter term leases will be more expensive per month.
Mckinley Properties don't allow less than 12 month lease but they offer a early termination option which costs 2x monthly rent and requires a 60 day notice. This could be just as good as a shorter lease. I'd confirm it with the leasing office but this should be for all washtenaw county mckinley properties.

1fygkbf,uofm,"So unbelievably, mind-numbingly, gut-wrenchingly lonely","Don't really know why I'm here. It's nice to know this subreddit exists. I guess I just needed to get this out so someone here knew there was a student in their ranks who is struggling and at the end of a long and very tired rope. A lot of you have probably seen me walk by you and don't even know it. I'm all over North and Central Campus.

I am a transfer student and in several organizations. I also work at a large company when I'm not here. I'm an older student. Every day, every week, I am surrounded by coeds and colleagues who are almost half my age. People my age seem to be in all the areas I'm not, and vice versa.

Never in my life have I felt more alone than I do now. How can I be surrounded by thousands of other people and feel like I don't belong at all, like I have no place anywhere in my life? I feel so isolated, so cut off from everything and everyone. Even my therapist has nothing to say except offering her condolences for feeling so disconnected from everyone. She suggested finding a support group outside of the university that has people my age, but where is the time for that? Life is a packed schedule of lean nonsense with little fat to clip.

Where did I go so wrong, to be at school so much later in life, to be working at a company full of people younger than me, and unable to find anyone I can relate to? How did such a seemingly-happy childhood devolve into an existence where if I were to disappear tomorrow, not a soul would notice?

I come home to a tiny apartment and try to pretend it's just another fine day in the books, but there comes the inevitable staring at the wall, feeling like I'm looking into the void of my soul that is missing such a fundamental connection and purpose in life. Not even a friend. No family to call. Just another day to come of walking as another face in the crowd, on the outside looking in.

For any of you who are quietly struggling on campus, you're not alone. I'm right there with you and struggling to keep on keeping on.

There is still a chance that both fail and are sent to the ballot box. Another outcome is that the Rebuilding Education in Gaza Act is ruled out of order per appropriations considerations in the All-Campus Constitution (see csg.umich.edu).  

A ton of other pieces of legislation are set for introduction, including multiple Disability Advocacy acts, a Scholarship Study Act, a Trans Protection act, and a bill to initiate the creation of a Psychology Minor in LSA.

I’d be happy to answer all questions about these proceedings as needed. Please be respectful in these comments. If you have criticisms, please attack the arguments and the logic rather than the individuals. People are in pain and we need to be constructive here.

1fxviqm,uofm,LING 137,"Warning because I’m about to be a mega hater but I have talked to many other people in the class this semester who all also feel this way. I have never seen a worse organized class before. I am a computer science major but have taken 2 linguistics classes in the past because I find the area of study interesting. The subject of LING 137 is pretty interesting, it’s basically about language standardization, and how no way of speaking is truly “incorrect”, and who decides what language is considered “correct” and “incorrect”.

The class is organized to be basically a “choose your adventure” kind of thing, where there’s a tonnnn of different assignments you can choose to do, and no late assignments are accepted since there's so many to choose from. However, in order to get an A in the class, you need to reach 1.2 MILLION POINTS. 1.2 million???? Out of a possible 2.9 million points. This grading scale is so absurd that the professor has to spend the first 15 minutes of each 50-minute lecture re-explaining how the grading system works. The smallest assignments are worth 5,000 points which is also ridiculous, I just don’t understand why everything needs to be in the thousands because it makes it feel way more overwhelming. We use GradeCraft so that you can hypothetically plot out which assignments you want to do, but there are so many goddamn assignments, most of which are 50,000 points or less, so it's just ridiculous to expect each student to go through and spend like an hour plotting this out. Plus, they grade the assignments really hard so you can’t actually plan out what you’ll need to do. Many of the assignments are multiple page essays, which is usually not expected of a 100-level linguistics course. In my other 100-level linguistics course, we had a simple worksheet to do every week or every other week. The instructors have to know that the vast majority of the people in this class were planning on taking it as an easy class to balance out their schedule.

I understand the idea behind this grading system - it’s to allow students wiggle room if they get sick or have a busy week so they don’t have to do assignments that week, and so students can pick and choose which assignments are actually interesting to them. But since there are so many assignments, many of them barely make sense. The past several weeks, 35 minutes out of the 50-minute discussion have been spent going over the instructions for upcoming assignments because the entire class is so confused over them. It really sucks because the course content is actually pretty interesting, but we move sooooo slowly through the lecture everyday, and it feels like we’re barely learning anything new. I could go on and on about all the things that frustrate me about this class, but I just needed to get this off my chest because every time I go to do an assignment for the class, I get so annoyed. I'm guessing that I and most people will still end up with an A in the class, but there is just so much unnecessary stress and confusion for a grading system that the class hates.","[""Lmao I'm sorry. This sounds Kafkaesque. Hope it doesn't sour you on linguistics altogether."", 'Millions of points feels absolutely insane imo.

Even though they say that you can choose what assignments to do, the amount of points we need to get an A makes it seem like that’s not even an option. The due dates make no sense to me. I feel like I’m always rushing to complete stuff the day of. I hate that none of the assignments are due at 11:59 pm. For example, why are there four assignments due at noon on Sundays? Also why are the after class comments due at noon the day after lecture?

For context, I’m living with a close friend, and the rest of our friend group has graduated. 

For freshman-junior year we were pretty active socially, from Greek life to going to the bars every weekend and tailgating in the fall. This year I’m feeling uninterested in all of those things- I’ve yet to go out at all and have gone to one game. Really all I want to do is focus on my schoolwork, spend time alone, and do more lowkey activities (ie trying new restaurants, going to movies, etc). 

I will say that I am taking a very challenging courseload that is overwhelming me a bit, and is maybe contributing to this. 

My friend thinks it’s extremely abnormal and pathetic of me to not want to make the most of senior year and have fun- is it? 

More importantly, am I being a bad friend by sitting out of a lot of these social activities (football games, going out, etc) that we used to do together, but I’m no longer interested in at all?

Friendship should include doing things that you mutually enjoy, and occasionally doing things you don't necessarily enjoy because your friend needs some help or just to make them happy.

1fxu59p,gatech,"Struggling as a first year, I feel like my brain is fried","Hey everyone! I’m a first year at Tech (this is my first semester) and I just wanted to come on here and rant about some frustrations since coming here.

I never thought I would end up at Tech because truly I applied on the whim. However the school I wanted to go to didn’t really work out especially cost wise. So here I am at the next best option. But to cut costs I’m commuting and the travel time is around an hour with traffic. I have classes 5 days a week (most of which are 8:00 ams) so not only do I have to get up 2 hours earlier than most people but I also get home later which really sets me back when it comes to doing homework or studying, because by the time I get home I just want to rest.

I have been doing my assignments on time however I don’t feel like I’m learning anything. It feels as if I’m doing the work just to do the work. And it’s not that I don’t want to learn, but it’s that everyday there is a new topic and I don’t have the time or the mental capacity to truly retain much of it especially when I’m taking 15+ credits this semester. It’s like during the class I’ll understand, but right after it’ll just leave my mind because now I have to focus on another subject. But when I get back to the previous subject, we’re already learning a new topic. I just feel like I can’t yk? Like I just can’t. I’ve thrived on academic validation my whole life, so seeing how I’m struggling with my classes hurts me as a person. I want to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA for my scholarship but at this rate it’s just so hard.

I’ve went to tutoring, I’ve went to office hours, I’ve went to recitations, and I’ve even done study groups. But barely have they helped. I even have regular appointments at the mental health resource center. But it has truly taken such a toll on my emotional and mental state because in all honestly I feel stupid and dumb being at tech and just so behind everyone else. Everyone seems like they know what they’re doing and what they want to be in life and here I am just stuck. 

I’m so tired and burnt out man like what can I do?? Seriously. I have no motivation, I feel burnt out and like my brain is fried, and every Sunday is like hell cause i know what the week holds.

I really feel like not many people actually come out and say how bad they’re struggling. So here I am actually saying I am STRUGGLING. Any advice? Or if anyone can relate please or have been through this, please tell me how you managed. And if anyone wants to be my mentor or something, please let me know cause I could really use one.","['When I was a TA, I saw students who lived far off campus struggle.

I’m a student who just returned to Tech this semester after going through the readmission process. Unfortunately, things have been really rough since the start. Literally a day before the semester began, some unexpected issues with my housing came up, and I ended up having to live in my car for the first six weeks of the semester. While my housing situation has stabilized now, my commute is about 40 minutes each way (without traffic), which is still adding a lot of stress.

All of this combined has put me in a constant game of catch-up. I’m barely finishing homework on time, and when midterms came around, I had to choose between studying or completing assignments. I’ve been trying really hard to hold everything together, but I feel like I’m slowly losing my grip.

My grades have been slipping, and I’ve had the worst midterm performances of my academic career so far (I got a 51, 70, 73, 70, and 87). I feel like I’m in a hole that’s getting deeper at a rate of 3x, and I can only climb out at 2x. I’m really starting to lose hope and can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Is there anything I can do to maybe buy myself some time, or any steps I can take to get back on track? Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks.","['Reach out to the dean of students.

1fxabl0,gatech,"Student football fans, we have some things to work on","First off, it is amazing we are filling out BOTH endzones. I am so excited about how far we've come. This post is a little bit of venting and some constructive criticism about a few incidents during the Duke game, but overall, it is incredible to see our student body showing out to cheer on the Jackets!

Still, there are a few things we need to improve on to be the fanbase these players deserve.

Most importantly, I think we can all agree that the trash thrown on the field on at least three occasions was completely unacceptable. As a fanbase and school, we have a reputation to develop and uphold, and we will not be like certain other fanbases in our state and conference. If you need a more tangible reason, our team will be penalized during the game and that could result in serious consequences within the game.

Now, I'm sure the assholes actually doing this stuff aren't going to be reading this post. All I ask for from y'all is a zero tolerance for these types of things and make sure ""fans"" like this know that they do not belong in the student section.

On a less serious note, we really need to shut up when our offense is on the field. Chanting and cheering is cool when the stakes aren't too high, but if our team is trying to finish off a drive in the redzone, it does not help when their fans are shouting at them. Consistent homefield advantage is incredibly important and we will desperately need it against Notre Dame and Miami in the coming weeks. Help me out here and let your friends know to quiet down when we have the ball.

On the other hand, we have been fantastic in bringing the noise when we're on defense. Keep that up and turn it up to 11!

Maybe I'm overreacting to some of this stuff, and feel free to call me out if that's the case. This is just an extremely valuable aspect of student life for me and I felt like something needed to be said.

Thank you to all who have been showing out to these games. We've had some growing pains to go through, but I believe we are on track to make Bobby Dodd one of the best stadium environments in the country.

At the end of my first semester I was talking to my dad (also a GT grad) about it and he gave me some advice that ended up working for me: You have to treat college as a 9-5. This means studying / doing homework between classes, planning out your work, and using as much time as you can during the day. This helped me a lot, as my first semester I would go to my dorm between classes and watch Netflix, or hang out with friends, or just do nothing, then after classes I would study/do homework late.

1fuwrzf,gatech,Second guessing my internship :(,"So I'm a 4th year EnvE + ALIS major (and CHIN minor) and my original graduation date was fall 2025. I got this internship offer in the spring and I'm really excited, but it's going to push my graduation date to spring 2026. I mean, there's nothing wrong with graduating spring 2026, but I feel like I need to ""get in the work force"" as fast as possible. I talked to both my ALIS and EnvE advisors and they were both basically like ""nope not at all,"" but I still am delusional thinking I may be able to pull it off.

The thing is: I have 12 classes left (4 KOR, 8 CEE)...Here was my plan for the spring:

- KOR 4002 (I talked with the professor beforehand and can do the class online)

- VIP (any VIP class, but just for 1 credit b/c I've taken a VIP class before for 2 credits)

- ECON 2105 (there was a section that was async this semester so I'm just praying there is an async one next semester)

- I was thinking of doing CEE research as well...

I was thinking I could take 4 classes over the summer, but higher level CEE classes aren't usually offered over the summer, same thing with Korean.

I know this sounds like super duper crazy and like out of it, but idk...I already feel bad about the possibility of me being a full on fifth year. I heard Cabrera speak yesterday saying ""oh yeah, we're not the best with 4 year graduation rate, we need to work on that"" as if it's the student's fault.

Was wondering if there are any classes offered by VRI for mba students? If not, how can we engage ourselves with this institute? 

Can I contribute as a MBA student here? 
If not, what are the other ways I can learn and contribute as someone in risk management?

There's no way to know about acceptance rate, but I would say that LS is probably easier to transfer into due to it's generality. LS is quite basic, and Gallatin is incredibly specific... due to the nature of its individuality and purpose of the school. If your potential concentration is not incredibly clear or unsupported by your past professional/academic/personal activities, consider applying to LS instead. \n\nI have a friend who was in your position. She ended up applying directly to Gallatin and getting in; she was pretty clear about her concentration AND had a multitude of credits from her other university that was super relevant to her concentration. \n\nI liked LS for my first year, but I loved Gallatin in the long run. I wasn't very inspired by LS, and it was quite easy academically (which is a plus and negative, depending on who you ask). It just depends on your priorities. If all you care about is getting into NYU... sure, maybe do LS. If you genuinely plan to later internally transfer into Gallatin, you shouldn't waste time (or tuition) in LS. You will graduate late most likely if you start in LS, since you are already transferring. \n\n  \nAlso, if NYU likes you, but doesn't think you're prepared enough for Gallatin (yet), you could be admitted to LS instead. That's what happened to me (different school, same idea), and a bunch of my friends. You just check off the box in common app from what I can remember. \n\n  \nHope that helps!"", 'its hard to discern whether one program or the other has higher acceptance rates because i’ve heard of people from wide application stats get into both schools.']",music_bat,1728310468.0,8
