1g0gvaa,harvard,Has the Harvard Crimson ever retracted/apologized for supporting the Khmer Rouge ,"This is a very specific question, and it obviously happened a long time ago, so I don't know if anybody will have an answer for me. 

I have been reading the Harvard Crimsons old coverage of Cambodia, where the crimson openly supports the Khmer Rouge. Now prior to the fall of Nol's Military dictatorship and Americas bombing campaign, supporting the Khmer Rouge is understandable. However, after the Khmer Rouge takes power and begins Yero Zero in 75, the Crimson while still supporting them out a kind of ""socialist solidarity "", the news of atrocities begins to cause some trepidation. (Cambodia and Crimson Politics - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/9/1/cambodia-and-crimson-politics-pbobne-day/) 

However by 76, as what is probably the worst genocide since the Holocaust is in full swing, the crimson has not only continued its support for the Khmer Rouge but has moved to open genocide denial. (Red Scare Over Cambodia - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/2/28/red-scare-over-cambodia-pbpbress-poison/). 

Thus my question is, has the Crimson ever retracted/apologized for their support for a regime that it is not hyperbolic to say is comparable to Nazis in their crimes against humanity, and is there anywhere I can read it. ","['College kids hold misguided views. More news at 11.', ""Interesting parallel to the Crimson's continued support of Hamas, even after its murderous October 7th rampage.

1frz4z4,harvard,Too many options,"Upperclassmen,

How did you deal with having so many interesting courses to choose from. If someone is for example interested in a couple different fields of physics or math or history or anything else consecutively, how did you narrow it down or decide?","['\nI didn’t come to Harvard for undergrad; what I did when I was in undergrad a decade ago was I just took classes - I was on track to have one major and three minors and in the end I dropped two minors because I just wanted to graduate. In the past few years I’ve come across triple major and quadruple major people so I assume that taking classes in different fields is even more common now.\n\nThat said, in the end I believe I chose the wrong major for me. I was fine studying it but didn’t love it - when I graduated with a capstone internship I didn’t want to continue to in the field, although my degree wasn’t a hindrance for my career afterward.\n\nThe same thing happened with my first master’s a few years ago - loved the field before going in, volunteered and interned and decided I wanted in, studied it - liked it but didn’t love it the same way my classmates did (but I really thought I liked it; turned out people could be a lot more passionate and I stood out in my cohort for not being that crazy about our field). I did a lot of projects during the degree and after my graduation internship I didn’t want to continue in the field.\n\nThen a few more years of work brought me to my second master’s at Harvard and I love it, and I didn’t think I would have loved the field this much.\n\nCareer-wise I’ve been in 5 unrelated industries throughout my working life and have done more than five different functions. I’ve had side hustles and I’ve had side “careers” purely for fun (I wrote a few novels. I had a blast and made less than a month’s salary lol and I took a lot of student jobs in the performance industry just for fun and they make interesting stories now - but no money).\n\nMy point is, maybe you won’t narrow down or decide per se. You might end up pursuing all your interests at the same time or consecutively - in college that’s pretty normal, and in career it might be less ideal depending on what you value (some people do value a more standard career and there’s nothing wrong with either option; sometimes I wonder too what would have happened if I found my industry earlier or went into a more popular option right out of the gate) but it happens and it’s perfectly fine too when it happens. I’m pretty successful at what I do even though I’ve hopped around; I don’t make a ton of money since my industry isn’t that well paid overall but I do make “a lot” for my industry and I’m comfortable, I believe it’s because after hopping around I did finally find things I’m good at + passionate enough about.\n\nI do have a few tips that I wish college me knew though:\n\n**1 - Challenge all your assumptions:**\n\nI pursued my major because I assumed my “conservative” parents wouldn’t agree to me studying humanities and I didn’t even know anyone who did humanities; and I thought it was a smart choice because “humanities don’t pay”.\n\nIn the end it turned out:  \n- my parents (who are not even conservative) didn’t give a damn what I studied at all but I didn’t communicate well with them; they totally thought I loved my major  \n- I was not the type of person that could bear a job I wasn’t 100% in love with; some people are fine with it, I happened to not be, and again nothing wrong with either but people are different  \n- humanities do pay if you know what you’re doing; there are careers that are major-agnostic and there are certainly well or at least okay-paying jobs in humanities fields  \n\n**2 - Decide what matters to you**\n\nBluntly put, some people don’t care what they do in a day job, some people do;  \nSome jobs don’t care what you studied, some jobs do;  \nSome people don’t really need to have a lucrative job, some people have to pay back loans, etc.\n\n**3 - Working in something and studying something is often different**\n\nTry out different jobs through internships & volunteer opportunities, talk to folks who are working, talk to your profs who’ve been in industry, network network network.\n\nAs a student you’re actually juggling deciding two things, what you study & what you’ll do as a job.\n\nSometimes these two aren’t even necessarily the same things but then you’ll need to prepare for both. (For example you can study history and in the end work in investment banking; but that means doing all the necessary steps as well outside of your major, such as learning financial modeling and getting the right summer internships from at the latest sophomore year.)\n\nDepending on your situation maybe one of these things (what to study & what career to pursue) is more important to you and you’ll need to prioritize that. I’ve come across a lot of students who prioritize what to study while not networking hard enough to figure out what they wanna do or to prepare for it. Networking is not just for extra extroverted people, it’s literally necessary imo just to find that options are out there and find out what they are like as much as possible.\n\nI’ve also seen some people who focus too much on what to do when they graduate and stress themselves out - I know undergrad at Harvard is probably a lot more intense than where I went to (also it was a different time) but try to have some fun with your classes too, especially requirements that you need to fill anyway. Not all classes have to immediately pertain to your future career either. I never ended up working in anything remotely related to physical anthropology but that one class I took in undergrad is still some fond memories for me. It opened my eyes to a new world and was fun.\n\n**4 - In the end with all your perfect planning things might not turn out as planned**\n\nAnd that’s ok. Frankly it’s just life. Lots of people change careers later or go back to school or both.

1fovmnk,harvard,The problem with the Sasha the HUPD dog (Campus mascot police dog ),"As a dog at HUPD (yes, a proper trained bomb-sniffing dog), I have had it with the Sasha ""HUPD dog."" For those who don't know Sasha or the HUPD dog is a 3-year-old ""social support"" dog similar to Elvy at Brown or Coach at Princeton. These washed up soft-pawed unimpressive chumps bark like they actually belong when in reality there is almost nothing in common between them and the regular K-9s in anti-drug or bomb units who are very bright, motivated, and create an inspiring environment in campus PDs. And this is not just me, almost every dog whose butt I sniffed does not like Sasha.

To clarify, not including the proctor and tutor dogs, Remy the cat, CPD horse units and the raccoons that visit the Lehman Hall dumpsters, all of which are proper campus animals who are very capable. Sasha is the anomaly, the executive canine money maker for Harvard which features in a ton of uninspiring old selfiess each year.

At dog training schools, K9 student dogs are not an issue as they're either separated into their own classes and cohort, or they're few in number. However, at Harvard, Sasha is in events with regular students asking dumb questions and making droning monologues that are more emotion than substance. Let's be real, if they're not failing in their transformative experiences, they wouldn't be taking selfies with a washed-up auntie pup hag. Anyone normal who hears the cringe washed up auntie bark would probably want to blow their brains out. How can Harvard let Sasha be the canine face on campus when there are squirrels to be photographed everywhere? And whatever happened to the turkey suit mascot?

As I have been ranting, I feel the need to propose some solutions

1. Dramatically reduce the Sasha pictures and public appearances
2. Separate Sasha department. Let campus services have her and feed her HUDS leftovers.
3. Have Remy be the campus comfort animals.
4. Clearly label her 'for entertainment purposes only' and make a real dog like me the feature ","['It’s about time someone raised this issue. Thank you for having the courage to do so.', ""I am so incredibly confused by this post and what it's trying to convey"", 'OP is making the entirely valid point that real two year masters degree candidates at HKS belong at Harvard, much like the real bomb sniffing dogs of the HUPD belong in the Harvard law enforcement community.

Where is the Crimson on this important issue? It’s time the Board of Overseers took action.\n\n(In the interest of full disclosure, my entire family got to pet Sasha and collect her card at commencement this year. Despite this blatant bit of pandering to the masses, the real Harvard community knows who belongs. And who doesn’t.

1fomtqf,harvard,Making friends after taking a leave of absence,"Thanks for everyone's helpful feedback on my other post. This is a more niche question, but I was also wondering if anyone had suggestions on how to reintegrate/ make friends after returning from a pretty long leave of absence. All of my friends have already graduated and everyone from my original class year is pretty much gone. I kind of feel like a freshman all over again, but instead of being in the yard where it feels like everyone is trying their hardest to get to know new people, I'm in a house where it seems like everyone already has a pretty solid network of friends and people they know.   
I'm trying to join some clubs at the moment, but I'm waiting on hearing back on comp/ applications. Ultimately, I just feel lost socially and am having a hard time figuring out what to do. ","[""Activities and extracurriculars are probably the way. People are constantly trying new things and meeting others for the first time as a result, regardless of academic year. Look for opportunities where you're spending a lot of time together, or forging bonds by fire -- for example, comping a process. Maybe join your House HoCo, where people tend to be pretty sociable. Take classes that involve problem sets, and find a study group. Seek out transfer students if possible. And talk to your House's housing coordinator, maybe see if they can move you (next semester or next year) into a rooming group where someone has left for study abroad or other reasons."", ""I was in the same boat as an undergrad at the college \\~10 years ago. I think the move is to structure the things that you have to do regardless like studying, classes, housing, eating at the dhall, etc. into opportunities to engage socially. Take classes with group projects or one with problem sets and form a study group. Join extracurriculars known for their social life. Join the HoCo or at least make an effort to consistently show up to house events and participate in house life like intramurals. Make it a point to schedule meals with people. Inevitably you'll still feel lonely sometimes as Harvard is set up for people to make their core friend/blocking group as a first-year but there are plenty of other people on campus looking to make friends as an upper classman. You'll also have a head start on learning the life skill of making friends and following up with people.""]",Top-Door-771,2024-09-25 02:11:49,7

1fnrq3g,harvard,Making the most out of being at Harvard College,"Settling into the realization that I will be here for another few years, I might as well take advantage of what I can. What are some of your recommendations on how to make the most out of being at the college?","['* Make a list of 1-5 things you legitimately might want to do in a future (PhD in X, join company Y, etc.) and work backwards from there to prioritize what really matters (from a career/post-grad POV).  Lots of stuff becomes unimportant when you realize it is truly disconnected from anything at the top of your list.\n\n* Periodically redo the above exercise--your top 5 or understanding of what matters may change.\n\n* Interview current students ahead of you, recent grads, and/or older alumni about their paths.  Use that to again check your prioritization list.\n\nIf the above sounds like a bunch of work...it isn\'t supposed to!  It is supposed to do the opposite--help you deal with rampant FOMO, because there are a bazillion possible time sucks, including for things that you think you *might* want (""well what if I *did* want to join McKinsey?"") but truly don\'t.\n\n* Clubs really don\'t matter that much, except 1) for very specific paths and 2) insofar as they are directly teaching you critical things.  Don\'t stress too much, and don\'t spend more time on them than you actually can rationalize.\n\n* Your specific coursework similarly doesn\'t matter for most pursuits.  This doesn\'t mean that learning doesn\'t matter, but rather than class X versus Y likely won\'t matter in 5 years, so don\'t stress if you can\'t fit in a specific course or second concentration or whatnot.  Exceptions to all of this, of course, for very specific paths like PhD in STEM fields.\n\n* Along those lines, figure out how much your GPA matters.  \n\nThis might sound a little odd, but going back to the ""top 5"" list--\n\nThere are a lot of paths where your GPA really doesn\'t matter (as long as it isn\'t awful).  But also a few where it really does (certain graduate programs, as limited # of high-end career options, etc.).  \n\nIf you\'re gunning for a path where that ~4.0 really does make a difference...have at it.\n\nIf you\'re not (and be honest with yourself), 1) relax a little and 2) put your energies elsewhere.\n\nKnow/learn what you need to do.\n\n* Summer internships are great, both from a career POV (crucial for resume) and for getting you outside of the Harvard bubble.  Understand how the application processes work, and treat it like a priority activity.  Success (first internship) begets success (more options for second) here.\n\n(This doesn\'t mean that if you don\'t get your dream internship you\'re hosed!  Just each step is marginally easier, if you\'re thoughtful in building a path forward.)\n\n* Go into Boston occasionally.  Even if just to walk around with friends.\n\n* Exercise. Lift weights.  Maybe start a martial art like BJJ.\n\n* Lastly, run the same ""top 5"" exercise for things that you actually enjoy and/or help you recover.  Give bonus points for things which get you mixing with your classmates.', 'Make good friends.  Harvard alums are good to know.  They seem normal now but many of them will go on to do great things.  Like Conan O’Brien, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, Tom Morelli, Yo Yo Ma…', 'I’m going to approach this completely differently than the other comment here, just to give another perspective (though their advice is actually also great). While many strategies focus on building a long-term career through goal setting and prioritization, I think there’s a more holistic approach to enjoying college life without feeling like you’re sacrificing your future.\n\n1. Focus on Exploration, Not Just Optimization\nCollege is one of the few times in life when you’re surrounded by a huge variety of people, ideas, and activities. By stepping outside of a hyper-focused path, you might stumble upon something you’re passionate about, even if it doesn’t align with pre-set goals. A flexible, exploratory mindset may still lead to career success, but it also creates room for serendipity. (I stumbled into my current career path because of this)\n\n2. Enjoy the People and Build Relationships, Not Just Networks\nNetworking is important, but don’t approach every relationship with a career-oriented lens. Instead, enjoy genuine connections with people because those are the relationships that often end up shaping your life. Career networks are fine, but the friends who stick by you through the highs and lows will be just as—if not more—important.\n\n3. Balance Achievement with Personal Fulfillment\nI’d say focus on doing things that make me happy and fulfilled—whether that’s joining a fun club, pursuing a hobby, or taking classes purely for interest. Sure, academics and career goals matter, but finding activities that give you joy and balance out the stress is what makes college a memorable experience.\n\n4. Use Mistakes as Learning Opportunities, Not Career Setbacks\nMany stress over GPA, internships, and getting everything “right.” But I think it’s more productive to embrace mistakes as learning experiences rather than career-destroying failures. It’s in those moments where you find personal growth, and that can build resilience for your future career. Nobody cares if your (massively inflated) GPA has a handful of non-A’s on it. But being able to speak candidly about your growth in your ability to handle increasingly complex material, your past failures and subsequent growths will pay dividends in your life. \n\n5. Career Can Wait; Experiences Can’t\nA job or a career path can be pursued at any point in life. But this moment, surrounded by a unique environment with access to resources, people, and freedom to explore? That’s limited to now. If you can, try to travel, attend events, and engage with people beyond just my field of study because those are experiences you can’t replicate later. \n\n6. Physical and Mental Health Over Resume Building\nExercise, sleep, and mental well-being should come first. Burning out in the name of career preparation isn’t going to pay off in the long run. Building a healthier lifestyle now will benefit your future success far more than a perfect resume will.\n\nIn short, my approach is to prioritize personal growth, meaningful connections, and life experiences over a rigid focus on career optimization. That way, I’ll leave college with not just a diploma, but a set of rich memories and a fuller understanding of myself and the world around me.', 'Speaking in part from my mistakes—it’s an incredible experience, make the most of it:\n\n1) Be social—join clubs, hang out with your roommates/floormates, etc.  The best part of the Harvard experience is the people you meet.  Try not to eat alone (okay to break this rule occasionally if you’re an introvert).\n\n2) Take a couple out-there classes in a subject that’s totally new to you (make sure the professor/Q scores are good first though).  You’ll probably never have as much latitude to explore new things academically the rest of your life (possibly unless you become an academic yourself).  Philosophy of religion was a cool one for me—nothing to do with my concentration or my current professional life, but made a huge impact on my outlook on life.  Plus a great class on the politics of Shakespeare after not really enjoying Shakespeare in high school English classes.\n\n3) Take advantage of the libraries.  Widener in particular has one of the biggest and most diverse collections in the country (probably the world).  They’re not just great places to study, you can find books on basically anything you’re interested in.  (The Coop is also cool.)\n\n4) Don’t forget about your health.  Avoid pigging out at the dining hall, take advantage of the gyms and (weather permitting) the nice places around you to run (including along the Charles River).  Go on long walks in Cambridge (it’s especially beautiful in the fall).\n\n5) Work hard at your classes, and actively seek help from your classmates, professors, or TAs.  Again, the people around you are the best part of the experience.  Learn from them.\n\n6) Go to the Harvard-Yale football games (especially the home games).  It doesn’t matter if you like football/sports in general, it’s just a big party for your whole class.\n\n7) Make plans with your friends to go into Boston once in a while.  Go to Fenway, the Boston Symphony, the North End (my favorite), Chinatown, whatever.  There’s a lot to do, and it’s really easy to forget about it.', ""I miss the dining halls, common rooms, and libraries SO much.  Just soak it all in as much as you can.  I wish I could sit and read in the Leverett House library, Kirkland House library, Cabot dining hall along the huge window with the sunlight.  There are just so many amazing spaces.\n\nBut I'd really lean into just bonding with your friends and perhaps even making new social ties.  I agree with a lot of the other advice about club activity.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Oh, do IM crew if that's something you could see yourself doing!

1fmejho,harvard,The problem with the MC/MPA Program (Mid-career MPA),"As a student at HKS (yes, a proper 2 year degree student), I have had it with the MC/MPA ""students."" For those who don't know MC/MPA or Mid-Career MPA is a 1-year ""executive"" program similar to executive MBAs at business schools. These washed up 40+ year old unimpressive chumps think they actually belong when in reality there is almost nothing in common between them and the regular 2-year and PhD students who are very bright, motivated, and create an inspiring environment at HKS. And this is not just me, almost every 2-year student I've spoken to do not speak well of MC/MPAs.

To clarify, not including the PhD, HKS has three 2-year degrees, MPP, MPA, and MPA/ID, all of which have proper students who are very capable. The MC/MPA is the anomaly, the executive degree money maker for HKS which brings in a ton of uninspiring old wannabes each year.

At business schools, executive students are not an issue as they're either separated into their own classes and cohort, or they're few in number. However, at HKS, they're in class with regular students and dilute our experience by asking dumb questions and making droning monologues that are more emotion than substance. Let's be real, if they're not failing in their careers, they wouldn't be leaving their jobs at 40-50 years old.

There are countless moments that show the level of stupidity of these Mid-careers that I just couldn't believe Harvard actually allows them to carry degrees.

This current Kennedy School Student Government election cycle is another demonstration of this stupidity. Anyone normal who hears the current MC/MPA candidate (cringe washed up auntie) speak would probably want to blow their brains out. How can HKS let MC/MPAs run for student body president when they're here for only a year and couldn't be more disconnected from the core student body. The HKS Whatsapp group is also inflamed right now because of dumb arguments raised by MC/MPAs on data privacy to smear other candidates. Complete shit show.

As I have been ranting, I feel the need to propose some solutions

1. Dramatically reduce the class size of MC/MPAs and increase admissions standards
2. Separate MC/MPA classes. Let them have their own classroom experience with fellow 40+ year olds

1ffumt0,harvard,Harvard shields tier list based on aesthetics,,"[""I love the new HLS shield but I can't stand that they didn't capitalize iustitia as IVSTITIA. Did they not consult anyone from the Classics department?"", 'Miss the humility of the downward facing lower book, signifying yet to be solved mysteries\n\nI guess Harvard achieved omniscience in 1847', 'Rook B3', ""Tier list template: https://tiermaker.com/create/harvard-shields-17469824-2\n\nFor consistency, I'm using the shield designs from here: https://www.harvard.edu/about/history/shields. Other designs can be seen here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry_of_Harvard_University\n\nMy rankings are based solely on aesthetics and not on any symbolism. For anyone interested, the wikipedia page linked above explains the symbolism for most of these shields.\n\nS-tier:\n\n* The adorned Veritas shield is absolutely gorgeous. Nothing else to say.\n* HLS is very aesthetically pleasing. The clean curves and crimson color gradient are beautiful and remind me of stained glass windows. The ʟᴇx ᴇᴛ ɪᴜsᴛɪᴛɪᴀ on the white background is imposing and assertive, and it pairs well with the ᴠᴇʀɪᴛᴀs just above. Truth, law, and justice. Like the adorned shield, I have nothing negative to say about HLS.\n* SPH and HBS have similar qualities. They're both clean and instantly recognizable. The color balances both feel a tad heavy on the white but it's not a big deal. The crosses and their respective decorations look great. However, the outlines & border for HBS are much thicker than for any other shield, and I think it's too much. So HBS goes below SPH.\n\nA-tier:\n\n* HDS: I'm a sucker for chevrons and this one has the perfect thickness and placement. The holly sprigs and wood pigeons fill out the space decently, but also make it feel a bit crowded and messy. The pigeons also make the color balance feel a bit too white.\n* SEAS doesn't look too great in this image but it's just because of the dark background of the image. When the shield is placed on a lighter background it [looks much better](https://imgur.com/a/AK9hBJ9). The chain stitch is a nice detail. The ragged cross isn't particularly alluring but it does strike a good balance between being too plain and being too noisy.\n* College: The chevron on this one is good, but it feels a bit thin. There's some open space to the left & right of the chevron but it's not a big deal. Looks great overall.\n* HMS is cool at first glance, but if you look closely, the lion looks kind of weird and deformed. If it were the [lion on the wikipedia page](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Harvard_Medical_School.svg/1657px-Harvard_Medical_School.svg.png) that I linked above, HMS would be S-tier.\n\nB-tier:\n\n* Veritas / FAS: Bread and butter. It's the ubiquitous base design and it's a tad plain, but still good.\n* GSAS is fairly plain. The white stripe doesn't add anything to the base Veritas shield, it just makes the shield feel too horizontal.\n* Dental: Among the shields that have the ᴠᴇʀɪᴛᴀꜱ chief at the top, this one is the most boring. Also the rectangular shape of the castle doesn't fill out the space well.\n* HGSE would possibly be in A-tier, but closer inspection reveals that (1) the two black flowers aren't vertically aligned, (2) the steps aren't all the same length, and (3) the steps have a weird diagonal lip at the top left. These all greatly annoy me.\n\nC-tier:\n\n* HES is wider & rounder than the rest of the shields which IMO looks worse. The chevron is too low and too thin, and it's at 42° angles unlike the 45° angles of the chevrons for HDS and College, which annoys me. The chief is not distinctly separated enough from the rest of the shield. The lamp and the bushels of wheat are okay though.\n* GSD looks awful. It's just way too messy. It's an eyesore.\n* HKS is somehow both too noisy *and* too bland. At least GSD *tried* to do something unique, this one is just a bunch of thin stripes and it looks terrible. Also the stripes become way too small at the bottom due to the shape of the shield.\n* Radcliffe just looks bad. The two black stripes are not enough decoration for a shield with no other details. The orange border feels too thick and I dislike that shade of orange, it feels too vibrant. Importantly, this shield is missing the black outlines and borders present in every other shield. I made a [quick edit](https://imgur.com/a/ymLEAln) of what this shield would look like with outlines and IMO it looks much better. The [old shield](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120143833im_/https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/sites/all/themes/rias/images/logo.svg) also looked much better."", 'I was today years old when I realized the HES shield is a different shape then the rest.

1fe0vmp,harvard,What was Harvard University like on 9/11?,"For people who attended or were at Harvard
University during 9/11. What was it like? ","['It was registration day. I was in my last semester on campus and my class had graduated that spring. So I had 10 good friends still in school and half of us lived off campus. We bundled up watching TV to figure out what was going on like most people. It wasn’t obvious at first but many friends were starting Wall Street jobs that month, but we were still at school. I remember walking across campus with everyone in a daze to drop off some paperwork. \n\nWe had shopping period then, so the next week was very odd. All interesting professors had to have an instant POV on the news and if their course would change. I took an economics of the middle east class. Usually it had 12 people in it - 50 showed up and the prof said the course was not going to change. My terrorism class went from 50 people to 250. \n\nThe other change was how militaristic the country and the campus became. I know folks that went to the military after that. In my building there was a HBS guy that was called back to the service. And debates about going to war with Afghanistan and Iraq increased throughout the semester. \n\nThat day was spooky for me. We knew the world had changed that morning but didn’t know why or how.', 'The weather was spectacular.  One of those perfectly clear fall days with no wind.  Warm, but just a hint of crispness in the air.  It was my junior year.  I remember getting woken up by one of my block mates shouting “someone just crashed a plane into the World Trade Center”.  \n\nMy memory is that eventually classes were cancelled, but nobody had gone anyway.  We were all glued to any TV we could find in our dorms.  The Internet was a thing, but social media was not.  So TV and news websites (cnn.com, nytimes.com, thecrimson.com etc.) were the main sources of information.\n\nIn the morning, the news came very fast, with first one, then the second plane hitting the towers (we all were watching live as the second plane hit), and then the attack on the Pentagon, and then the last plane going down in PA on the way to DC.    \n\n\nThere was a lot we didn’t know.  We had more comprehensive, and horrific, views of the attacks on the WTC than we did of the Pentagon and the site in PA.  We knew that the FAA was grounding all traffic, but reports kept coming in of planes in the air anyway.  The president and vice president were in undisclosed locations, and didn’t communicate until later in the day.  We learned that the attackers had taken off at Logan airport.  We worried about additional attacks, including, to some extent, on Harvard itself.  There wasn’t much we could do except worry.\n\nSome students and faculty had friends and relatives in New York and DC.  And as the day went on most people had quiet phone calls with family and friends, wherever they were, to connect and confirm.\n\n  \nThoughts turned to what would come next quite quickly after 9/11.  But on the day itself we were watching, keeping our heads down.  Campus was quiet and still as we all tried to understand what was going on.', 'Quiet. The first unusual thing that I noticed before hearing the news was that all internet news sites such as NYTimes were timing out because of traffic. Later, I remember being glued to the television watching news.', 'i was in lab and people thought the footage was fake. people went home after that and called loved ones.', 'I remember waking up early in Wigglesworth from just the excitement of everything and still getting used to the Red Line rumbling underneath. I went out for a walk and everything was normal if quieter as an early morning would tend to be. \n\nOn my way back, I noticed there was an eerie, unsettling silence. The first plane had hit while I was out. I got back to my dorm and my roommate - usually a talkative New Yorker - was dead silent. I opened up my laptop and checked the news. Moments later, 175 hit the South Tower. \n\nThere as a lot of uncertainty and a lot of buzz. I remember the Crimson printed a special edition of the paper rapidly that was available at Annenberg. \n\nA helicopter was hovering above and near the Old Yard as Harvard was believed by some to be a potential target. \n\nIf memory serves, a bin Laden relative in one of the graduate or professional schools was reportedly secured as well. \n\nWe had an entryway meeting later to discuss. \n\nI also remember phone lines were virtually impossible to connect to NYC.

1f1n5n3,harvard,"Freshman Interesting in CS, Stats, etc: take Math 25","If you're an incoming freshman interested in something like CS, Stats, or even Math, and you have a modest math background (e.g. 5 on Calc BC in high school), you should take Math 25. 

As a CS concentrator, I, to a degree, regret not taking a harder math class freshman year (I took Math 21B and the highest level of math I did in HS was AP Calc BC). 

Taking Math 22 is okay, but I think you will get the most reward in terms of developing your math abilities by taking Math 25. Although it will take more work, I think you can find time to devote to the class if you take a very reasonable schedule along with it (second-hardest course is CS50, and then you take expos/frosh seminar and/or EC10). 

The fact is that if you have a strong foundation in calculus, but lack proof experience, you can take Math 25, although you will have to make sure to dedicate a lot of your academic schedule to it. I argue that the dedication is worth it, especially for a field like CS in my experience. 

Although you'll end up developing proof skills by taking the CS20 + CS120/121 + CS124, the mathematical maturity you develop from just taking Math 25A is probably equivalent to what you would get by taking the core theoretical CS series combined. People who take Math 25/55 also tend to perform better in CS124 because they're able to more comfortable quickly apply concepts from lecture to problems on exams. 

So TLDR, if you're studying CS or an adjacent field, at least take Math 25A freshman fall.

1fxvhcf,mit,Relationship Advice for a Patient Freshman,"I'm a freshman. I have a crush on a sophomore that lives right next to me. Am I cooked?

I've liked this person since the moment I saw them. Let's name them X. X is not only my type, but might be the most 'good' person I've ever met. They aren't afraid to be vulnerable and stick to their morals. 

I definitely wasn't thinking about asking out X anytime soon. I'm a freshman, so there's that whole power difference, adjusting and making friends thing. I also want time to sort out my feelings. Perhaps worst of all, they literally live right next to me. X's friend group (and now my friends) also live on the same section of the floor, and I really, really like everyone in the group. 

X hasn't dated before, and have indicated that they're open to dating. But because X is literally just too cool, they have cool friends, particularly one called Y. (If I were of a different sexual orientation, I would've totally had a crush on Y.) X's eyes light up whenever Y's name is mentioned, and they really are something of best friends. I could see them getting together, and I would be so happy for them and find them cute but feel sad and bitter inside at the same time.

If I don't ask out X, I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life. The question is to wait how long. I was thinking about, at earliest, spring semester, and ideally, when I'm a sophomore. I won't be able to see X over the summer. 

Currently, I'm thinking about getting closer to X by asking them to eat out with me every once in a while. Any advice?","[""I'm not sure if you've heard of the November rule before - when I was a student, it was the idea that upperclassmen shouldn't date frosh until November 1st. The idea behind it was, you don't want a frosh to form their entire social system on an upperclassmen's friend group. That would result in the frosh being entirely alone after a breakup, which isn't great.\n\nSo I think that needs to be your first priority. Make sure you're not hanging out with *only* them or their friend group. Grab lunch with other people, join a club or two, play a sport, whatever it is that you like to do that gets you in contact with other people and making other friends.\n\nBut once that's in place... frankly, I'm not in favor of waiting.

1fv0ejg,mit,I was an idiot in some Mathematics class ,"Hello everybody. 

My pardon for intruding, but just to get things out there I did not attend MIT as a student. While I say I did not attend, I did in fact show up for a class at MIT. I went to Boston University, just across the river and was given a ""challenge"" so to speak to attend any possible MIT class and either answer or ask a question in dumb fashion. 

My friend and I both showed up on general campus and began asking around what's the earliest class that's about to happen. We were led to a large lecture hall that was to be held for an advanced mathematics class of some sort. 

Upon the class beginning, my friend was planted near center of the hall while I was to the far right, closest to the door. I was originally supposed to be the one to ask whatever question, but my anxiety got the best of me. I signaled to my friend what was happening and he stepped in. 

He essentially asked to translate common math symbols on the board to English. Y'all went/go to MIT, I don't feel the need to explain this one. I do have this on video. 

Immediately after he asked his question, he left the room leaving just me. Watching the courage reign through no matter the embarrassment on his end was inspiring to me, so I ended up asking my original ""idiotic"" question.

This is an exact word for word on what happened:

Me: \*Raises hand\* keep in mind, I'm on the far right side of the hall. It is harder for the prof to see me. Someone maybe 8 seats down sees me and signals to the professor to call on me. 

\*Teacher points to me\* 

here we go folks

Me: ""I know this is a strange question, but what college is this by any chance?""

Prof: ""I'm sorry???""

Me: ""What college are we currently at?""

Prof: ""Ummmmmmmmmmmmm the Massachusetts Institute of Technology?""

Me: \*While prof utters the college, I slowly begin to lift from my chair\*

Me: ""Oh fuck, wrong school!"" I immediately run from my seat through the doors, leaving a laughing classroom behind. 

To this day I always think about it since I got my friend's question on film, but never mine (and mine was def funnier). 

Is there by any chance someone from that class may have caught it on film?????? I know I'm throwing a reel into a large sea here, but maybe there is hope out there.

Please look into starting salaries after graduation for MIT undergraduates. Adjust based on your anticipated field, YMMV.\n3. There is considerable aid for a wide range of incomes. I found my offer from MIT included more aid at the time than other less-expensive institutions and had a lower net cost. I have heard similarly for a range of other people, but YMMV\n4. With all postsecondary colleges and universities, there is a value to the experience, there is also a cost to attend. Both variables vary from institution to institution and include many intangibles. So if the value of the tangibles and intangibles exceeds the cost, you are likely to apply.', 'If you’ve saved nothing and have no ability to work, you’re not UMC. You’re… non-working working poor? \xa0\n\nBig difference going for a lucrative degree (CS) vs non (urban planning). Most people going into big tech or big banking can pay off that kind of loan in two years while having an improved lifestyle over undergrad.\n\nBut UMass can also give you an excellent education for a fraction of the price.\xa0', 'Where I’m from, $30k is pretty close to in-state cost at our state flagship. So my parents planned for that expense. NPC said a little less than $30k and it ended up being closer to $20k for us, so less than they expected to pay for college.\n\nBasically, MIT expects that your parents saved money for your college if you’re upper middle class. If they didn’t, or if they’re unwilling to help pay, you’re in a tight spot and would probably need loans. $120k is truly a lot of money, so I’d suggest talking to your parents and applying to financial safeties (so probably schools that would give you a big scholarship/merit aid) as well as your top schools, in case you can’t get it to work out.', 'MIT is one of less than 10 colleges in the US that is need blind (ability to pay is not considered as part of admissions) and full need (meaning that 100% of demonstrated financial need is covered with aid) for US applicants.\n\n“I could’ve gotten into MIT but they didn’t give me an offer because I asked for financial aid,” is something that no MIT applicant will ever have to say.\n\n“I got into MIT but didn’t go because my family couldn’t afford it,” is something that no MIT admit will ever have to say.\n\n“I didn’t bother applying to MIT because I didn’t think my family could afford it,” is something that only the misinformed would say.', 'Although many MIT admits could probably find some other options with huge merit scholarships if they are willing to be flexible about location, etc., $30K is about the in-state cost of a state flagship in higher cost of living states.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that about $20K of that is basically just room and board. You can likely shave some off of that by living in a cook for yourself dorm. \n\nIf you are upper middle class, it seems surprising that your family would pay that with 100% loans…no savings? no ability to cash flow any of it? \n\nWere your parents paying for things for you in high school?\n\nMIT also offers an installment payment plan so you don’t have to come up with $30K immediately in August.\n\nThat’s even before getting to the student’s ability to work, during term-time and over the summer.

1fipkjh,mit,Thought on MIT's Alumni Career Design Fellowship program?,"[https://www.missioncollaborative.com/mitfellowship](https://www.missioncollaborative.com/mitfellowship)

Hi everyone! Life has been messy recently. 

I graduated in 2021 with a BS in mechanical engineering (2A). I have been feeling pretty lost in the past three years since I have never truly enjoyed any of my jobs. I have recently been thinking that maybe I chose the wrong major, since I seem to like more the coding part of my projects. I have been wondering if  instead of product design (which is what I've done for most of my roles ), I should have focused in another mechanical engineering area, like  robotics. Or a completely different major, like CS. 

Furthernmore, I also had to leave the US in July (I was an international student who after 3 years of OPT didn't get the lottery visa), and so now I not only have to find a job but also restart my whole life. Anyways, it has been some very hard months and I feel super lost and money is running out. So I saw this program and thought it might help... has anyone done it or know about anyone who did it? I want to know if it is actually worth it. Thanks! ","[""This is a program that paid money to be advertised via the MIT Alumni website. Do a search for that name, you'll find ads targeting alumni of many schools. \n\nIf your life has been messy, maybe you need peesonal coaching help. I don't know if a career design program is going to help. I don't even know what a career design program is. \n\nGood luck."", ""No idea about the program, but do a reverse image search on the headshots in the testimonials they use on the website and you'll see that they are fake. I would tread carefully."", 'I\'ll be honest, this seems like one of those ""pay me for personal coaching"" MLM-type of programs.', ""I did this program and can relate to you: 2A w/product design, but enjoyed coding projects the most. After a number of years not enjoying my job and feeling stuck, decided to try this because I wasn’t making progress (out of laziness or fear, who knows) and hoped it would lead to some accountability at the very minimum. It did seem a bit weird that this is a 3rd-party program that runs at many universities. Good business model for the people running it I suppose.\n\nMy #1 goal entering the program was not necessarily to find a new career, but to make new connections with alumni. I liked the idea of regular meetings with a peer group that might lead to deeper conversation, camaraderie, and support beyond the program.\n\nThe content itself is nothing new. All self-help and career building is kinda the same, the coaching mindset is “the answers are within you, here is some work you should do to find them”. You have some reading each week and an assignment. The major difference with this program is the accountability you have with your peer group in presenting your thoughts/progress each week. It also sounds obvious but the course material is very career focused and I appreciated having some structured “worksheets” to get through, and discussing with others. It helped me get comfortable with storytelling my career and thinking about next steps.\n\nAlthough the program is over, I still keep in touch with my peer group regularly. I also reconnected with an old classmate who has become a great friend. I personally did not change careers, but 2/4 of my peer group did get new jobs. Was it worth it? For me, yes, but may not be for you if you are more disciplined than I, funds are super tight, or you've stayed connected w/alumni. I'd suggest getting a group of friends together,  working through a book like Design Your Life, or having a conversation with ChatGPT and ask it to act as a coach (I know there's a disclaimer not to use it as a therapist but honestly it's been helpful in bringing clarity to my thoughts...). A therapist is helpful to tackle self-worth and self-confidence if that's holding you back. You will make it through. Happy to chat more over DM."", 'Nah']",SeggsyLlama,2024-09-17 09:41:01,11

1f9i4tb,mit,PhD in Political Science (Security Studies): What's It Like?,"Hi all. I've just finished my master's degree in International Security (joint master's, at three universities/countries) and have somehow knocked it out of the park. I've got the highest grade classification (Distinction), a 4.0 GPA equiv, and I strongly suspect will be in the top 10 - potentially top 5 or higher - of my cohort (out of 99 students). I've never thought of doing a PhD before, but this has opened the possibility of dreaming a bit bigger.

I've seen MIT offers a [PhD in Political Science](https://oge.mit.edu/programs/political-science/) with a concentration on security studies, which - on the face of it - looks incredibly appealing. The ability to cross-register with Harvard for a few modules also sounds like the best of both worlds. That said, I'd love to know more about what the Center for International Studies is like, what doing a PhD at MIT is like, and whether I'm getting a bit too big for my boots of thinking to apply for this. In brief:

* For those who do their studies at the Center for International Studies, how good is it in terms of research calibre?
* The PhD seems long (6-7 years expected), and there's a risk of the first two years treading a lot of similar ground to my master's degree. For modules that I've already done in my master's, can these theoretically be swapped with other modules (i.e. if I wanted to sit in on a CS course/take a cross-registered course at Harvard instead, would that be kosher)?
* How 'common'/feasible is it to graduate earlier from a PhD - i.e. to complete it in five years rather than 6-7?
* Being frank, the alumni network and brand recognition does factor in to considering this. While both clearly hold for undergrad level in tech/science majors, does the same weight apply at PhD level with a focus on political science? - For reference, my research would be on certain tech applications in international security.
* I have zero intention of working in academia beyond this. My hope hereafter would be to move into private-sector industry relevant to my field. While *usually* PhDs don't seem a good route into this, the network/teaching/etc make this seem more plausible with years at MIT under my belt. Have I got the wrong end of the stick there, and to what extent is that myth more than fact?
* Last one, really: My master's was outstanding, but my bachelor's (many moons ago - graduated in 2015) was mid. Good (a 'two one' or 'upper second class' in the UK), but not the highest grade (first). Otherwise, a lot of good work XP and a first-gen uni student. Does a not-excellent BA grade scupper this entirely?

I appreciate any help you can give with this. Only other consideration I can think of is that I'm an international student (British). Hope you're all having a wonderful day. :) ",[],WhatDesireKnows,2024-09-05 14:51:33,1

People who go to this school are so smart, so forward thinking, so open-minded, so interested in changing the world and in pursuing their careers.

1f2m0zt,mit,Seeking Course Recommendations at MIT and Harvard - Brazilian Fellow with a Background in Open Data and Software Development,"Hello!

I'm seeking advice on which courses to take at MIT and Harvard. My wife has recently been awarded a fellowship with the Knight Science Journalism program, and as part of the fellowship, I have the opportunity to enroll in classes at these prestigious institutions.

A bit about myself: I'm from Brazil, 37 years old and have been programming since I was 14. I started working with Python back in 2005 and have since developed a strong foundation in software development, particularly in the realms of free/libre software (FLOSS), open data, GNU/Linux systems administration and data journalism. Over the years, I've taught courses in electronics, Arduino, and Python programming, sharing my passion for technology with others.

I also studied Telecommunications Engineering, completing nearly all the coursework, including subjects like calculus, physics, and statistics, though I did not finish the degree. This academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical and technical skills.

Currently, I run a small company in Brazil where we focus on projects that have a positive social impact using FLOSS and open data. We develop tools and platforms primarily using Python, Django, PostgreSQL (including PostGIS) and scrapy, mainly. Our work has supported numerous journalistic investigations and civic tech initiatives.  One of our most significant contributions has been the creation of [Brasil.IO](https://brasil.io/), an accessible open data portal that enables citizens to access Brazilian open data - this portal was crucial during the pandemic when the federal government stopped publishing daily municipal-level data, allowing people to stay informed and researchers to have access to this data. Recently, we’ve also been working with large language models (LLMs) to automate various tasks across several projects, including transcription, summarization, and extracting structured data from texts. If you're curious about the kind of work we do, feel free to check out some of our free/libre software projects [here](https://pythonic.cafe/software-livre.html) and more details on our projects [here](https://pythonic.cafe/projetos.html) (in Portuguese, but easily translatable).

I’ve been exploring the courses available through the following links: [MIT](https://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/) and [Harvard](https://courses.my.harvard.edu/psp/courses/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH). If you have any recommendations or insights, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your help!","['What are you looking to get out of a course?\n\nMIT often leans theoretical in nature - are you looking to get a more theoretical background in some area? Or are there practical technical skills you want to improve? Or business-running skills you want to expand on?', 'Instead of using the MIT catalog, try using hydrant.mit.edu it’s easier to browse and has the student ratings and info for each course neatly integrated.\nIt seems like you’d be interested in project courses in CS, so I’d recommend computer vision, nlp, robotic manipulation, and deep learning at MIT.', ""Thanks for the response! I'm more of an applications person rather than someone focused on theory. I'm interested in technical topics related to my experience, but I’m also keen on exploring the intersection with the humanities and business, especially since I run the company and serve as the technical lead as well.""]",turicas,2024-08-27 22:24:26,2

Looking for a bit of advice. I'm a single 34 year old male, moving to Stanford from the UK as a clinical instructor in the faculty of medicine in summer of 2025 and having never been there I'm not sure what to expect and would be grateful for any advice that could be offered.

I've been told to sign up for Stanford West apartments, looking at the criteria I think I'd fall into category 1C. What are they like? Are they good value for money in the area and are they well maintained? Is it

How easy is it to meet people in the area? I'm going out alone and don't know anyone in the country, leave alone the Stanford.

Is there anything I should know about the area that I'm missing?

  
Thanks for any advice.","[""Based on my 2 years of living in the Stanford area as a former staff member:\n\nPositives:\n\n* The area is incredibly safe\n\n* Gorgeous place to go for walks/runs \n\n* It's great having so many smart and ambitious folks in such a close proximity. \n\n\nNegatives:\n\n\n* Palo Alto and the surrounding areas are very suburban and family oriented, therefore you'll sometimes feel stuck and constricted to the Stanford bubble.\n\n* You will absolutely need a car to get out of said bubble. The Caltrain rail is nice although sometimes terribly inconvenient/slow. \n\n* Vehicle traffic is terrible. Biking is very popular but can be dangerous.

It\'s not cheap, but it\'s reasonable for what you get, which is an incredibly convenient, safe, and friendly community with *relatively* good management. As mentioned, there are many medical professionals there. As an example, at the time we left in 2020, we had a BMT attending on one side of us, an RT on the other, a peds hospitalist across the path, and a neurosurg attending next to them. It is particularly great for families with small children (e.g. multiple pools, multiple playgrounds, on-site daycare, large field, ~8 min walk to a huge shopping mall, occasional community events aimed at kids). However, as a single guy, you might find Stanford West a little boring. For example, the mall is virtually the only walkable option for food.\n\nIn response to the common negative characterization that Palo Alto is very ""surburban"", I don\'t necessarily see that as a negative. Within a 15 min drive from campus, you can find yourself within a Redwood forest in the mountains, and with another 10 minutes, you\'ll have views of the ocean that exceed anything you\'ll find in the UK.

They mostly build on the theory they introduce, so I don't think you need to worry about them suddenly dredging up some 106b concept you missed in the middle of the quarter. I haven't done leetcode before so I cant speak directly to applicability, but you can't really go wrong by learning theory haha; I can't imagine that it would be less useful than 106."", '106b is more like LC problems (towers of hanoi, backtracking) than 161 where its proofwriting for algorithms (some which might be not as applied). After 106B was when a lot of people started getting internships, i think that and LC will be good for you. Just make sure you put in extra work to understand runtime and spacetime complexity', 'hmm Im leaning towards 106B but curious to why you would prefer 161? is 106B not as helpful?', ""It's probably because I'm a bit theory-biased. If I could pass advice to my past self, it would definitely be to get the bottleneck prereqs out of the way as soon as possible to take the more fun higher series courses. The prereq chain for some courses can be quite long, and is probably easiest to shorten at the base. I'm in my senior year now and am having to make tough choices about which classes I'll have to let go simply from not having the unit capacity in my remaining time here. I took 161 in my sophomore fall, but it totally would have been feasible to put it earlier to get just a few more extraneous courses.\n\n\n(That being said, I suppose if your interest lies more towards systems/hardware, you may slant in the other direction. The 107->111->systems chains can be quite long as well.)\n\n\nAlso, just from an enjoyment perspective, 161 was way more fun and felt like it taught so much more. Similarly, from what I can see of the 106b stuff I scrounged up, there's really not much of a focus on runtime optimization in that class and I at least know that tech interviews are meant to be full of questions along that line. 161 definitely has a emphasis on time complexity.\n\n\nI'd say that if you can do 161, you totally should. That being said, definitely take your own confidence and programming knowledge into account.""]",Character-Capital-70,2024-09-24 08:29:11,5

My PI has never mentioned undergrads showing up at his office to ask for jobs, or if they did, it didn\'t work out. I\'d stick with email.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is what the other commenter said: undergrads (of any major) typically do not know enough to be able to be ""doing"" research. In general they are assigned a task that supports someone else\'s research, like a postdoc or graduate student. So this typically means they need to be trained, which is a time commitment that the lab member has to consider.

I've looked at UCLA, USC, and Cedar Sinai's programs and am confused about picking the best one. I saw the Pre-Med Volunteer Shadowing Program at Cedars Sinai but it seemed to be just volunteering. I am trying to find a volunteer position that would allow me to go and help in a certain specialty (neurosurgery/neurology) rather than just a shadowing position. It would even be fine if I started out with general tasks like administrative stuff or patient/lab sample transport if it meant that I would be able to be promoted to a level II volunteer and help out in a certain specialty. Also, it didn't state, but I am not sure if I have to be a UCLA or USC student for their programs. I also don't really know if I am qualified enough considering I have no clinical experience and it's clearly stated that the programs are very competitive and hard to get into. If anyone can give advice on this, I would absolutely appreciate it and you would really be doing me a solid!

It seems to me the timing is targeted at trying to overpower the focus Israel wants to put on exclusively October 7th. \n\nThis seems pretty clearly to be the answer rather than the bad faith accusation that it’s all just a secret anti-semitic ruse. This is prima facie false and an attempt to undermine legitimate issues with Israel. There is no denying that bad actors exist as with any sufficiently large and popular movement but the vast majority of these people don’t give a fuck about Judaism, they just hate Israel’s apartheid regime.', 'Answer: because the SJP leadership, which is overwhelmingly radical-nationalistic, considers October 7, 2023, to be a day of resistance (intifada). That’s where the Globalize the Intifada slogan comes from (meaning- “let’s do something like October 7 everywhere”). Members and followers of the SJP who are not that radical consider it to be a day when the bombing of Gaza started, which is technically sort of true, but October 8 would be an much more appropriate and less inflammatory day to do this in my opinion.']",Redditlogicking,2024-10-08 14:23:42,290

In 1993, he completed his postdoctoral training in biophysics with* [*David Agard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Agard) *at the* [*University of California, San Francisco*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco)*.* 

*Baker joined the Department of Biochemistry at the* [*University of Washington School of Medicine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington_School_of_Medicine) *as faculty in 1993.""  (Wikipedia)*

Adding that Professor Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine ~~Chemistry~~ in 2013.

Baker's co-winners this year are Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, both of whom are based in London and currently work for Google DeepMind.  Baker receives 1/2 of the prize money and the other two 1/4 each.

So, the streak of close-but-not-close-enough continues with UC Berkeley and the Nobel Prize this year. **Of the prizes announced so far--Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry--one recipient of each prize has a direct Berkeley connection, but none of the three were on the Berkeley faculty when they won the prize.**

Interestingly of the three Berkeley-related winners, one received his undergraduate degree at Cal, one received his Ph.D. here, and the third was an Assistant, then Associate, professor here.","['""One received his undergraduate degree at Cal, one received his Ph.D. here, and the third was an Assistant, then Associate, professor here""\n\nThis is remarkable. I wouldn\'t call this ""close, but not close enough."" The Berkeley community should be very proud of being a critical part of nurturing and developing these world-changing minds.', 'Bring back the seal', 'Awesome to see Baker honored, his lab consistently puts out the most amazing work and his grad students and undergrad researchers have been able to create some amazing work and come back to Cal as grad students or more. Also more validation for AI/ML research!', 'Some small corrections — Baker received his PhD in biochemistry, not chemistry. Biochemistry is a department that was folded into MCB. Also, Schekman’s Nobel was in Physiology or Medicine.', ""Here's a quote from Ruvkun himself on the impact of his Berkeley undergrad experience.\n\n“Physics at Berkeley was taught in a more inspirational way,” Ruvkun said in a 2011 profile by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Upon receiving the Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008, he remarked, “it is possible that my undergraduate training in physics taught me not quantitative reasoning, but rather how a scientific revolution at its very beginning can be recognized.”""]",OppositeShore1878,2024-10-09 15:33:56,142

And what's frustrating is that these problems could be solved by replacing these urinals with waterless urinals.

No matter what side you’re on, signs like these are extremely insensitive and dehumanizing to Jewish people and communities. Framing the horrors and violence of October 7th as a day of “resistance” or a “celebration” is completely unacceptable and will only cause pro-Palestine groups to lose support. You can still advocate for Palestinian aid and liberation without terrorizing Jewish communities who are trying to mourn.

{Applicants with excessive transferable semester units (89 or more from a four-year institution or those who complete coursework at a community college and then transfer to a four-year institution) are ineligible for admission.} I have troble compreheding this. 

[https://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/junior-transfers/](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/junior-transfers/)

What if I have prerequisites for core classes for General Chemistry and Calculus? I need to take trigonometry and precalculus since I only have a GED and a preparation course for general chemistry that’s designed for students who didn’t take chemistry in high school in my CC. My plan ends up with 89 units. Until when I saw this announcement that was confusing for me. The main question is, the max transferable units you can transfer is 70, and I know that’s fine it’s normal. But what exactly does 89 units mean? I’m worried that if an applicant has more than 89 units, then Berkeley Engineering won’t even consider the student as an applicant. What I mean by “not as an applicant” is that even if the student got a 4.0 GPA, the outstanding PIQs, exceptional extracurriculars, and also the student saved the world. Then all due to the fact that the student ends up with 89 units; therefore, Berkeley admission  won’t view the student as a eligible junior transfer applicant.

And what if students has completed IGETC as an engineering/STEM major? I know that Berkeley doesn’t accept IGETC for sure (Junior transfers needs to complete 4 additional HS/S classes later in Berkeley) , but some students do it because they also applied to other engineering schools that accepts it. This way, after they transfer, they don’t have to take any more humanities or social science classes, which can save them some money. But if you finish all the lower-division classes like Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Physics, and programming, PLUS, the IGETC, you’ll definitely exceed 89 units. Even if you started with Calculus 1 (single-variable calculus, the first university calculus class). Thank you all so much.","[""They don't care. They're all undergrad units, only 70 will count towards your BA, and you can also do courses to get rid of requirements. So they will check off the requirement but sometimes not necessarily the units. You could have 200 units at CC. They don't count that against you. Just know, only 70 will be counted towards your BA. This ensures you do the other 50 in upper division courses."", 'As longs as they are all lower division units and/or from a CC, it doesn’t matter how many you have, you’ll get 70.

This was after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.\n\nHere\'s the announcement of the program, from 1997. [https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors/berdahl/speeches/SAFER-program-announcement](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors/berdahl/speeches/SAFER-program-announcement)  \n\nI couldn\'t find a link to a current update, but I would imagine one is out there somewhere. \n\nThe work has now been ongoing for nearly a quarter century. Every campus building and off-campus UC owned building was evaluated, they were all rated as to hazards, and a plan put in place to either retrofit or demolish them one by one.  I don\'t think it is quite done yet, but scores of buildings (including all the residence halls, and most academic buildings on campus) have been upgraded and repaired. Usually the retrofit work was combined with other upgrades / improvements to buildings. \n\nThe program was not to ensure that the buildings would be fully useable right after a major earthquake, but to reduce life-threatening hazards (like a building collapsing, or parts of it falling on people). \n\nOff campus, in the City of Berkeley, the City has had a program for years to reduce hazards of ""soft story"" or unreinforced masonry buildings. Unreinforced masonry is basically brick or concrete buildings without sufficient strengthening to survive a major earthquake; fortunately, there are not that many of those in Berkeley, and most have been strengthened. ""Soft story"" buildings were often built in the 1950s through the 1970s, and included a lot of apartment buildings that had parking garages under the building near, or at, street level. I think most of those have been earthquake retrofit as well.\n\nThere\'s not, so far as I know, a specific set of City programs on reinforcing older wood-frame buildings, but the good news there is that smaller wood frame buildings, like Berkeley\'s older houses, are fairly resistant to earthquake shaking as long as they have newer, or repaired, foundations. (The State of California does have foundation reinforcement programs for homeowners and apartment building owners). \n\nNone of this is to say that there won\'t be major damage in Berkeley from a major earthquake nearby.

The following has been edited for length and clarity.*\n\nI\'ve been a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley since 2000.\n\nRecently, I\'ve noticed how difficult it is for tech graduates to enter the job market right now.\n\nAt least in technology, it\'s a very different landscape than it has been in the past. It\'s not just my students; it\'s a hard time for everyone right now.\n\nOver the years, students I\'ve worked with, taught, or known from other schools have typically had little trouble finding a job after graduating with a tech degree.\n\nThere were lots of opportunities. Quite often, recent graduates would receive multiple offers and be left to try to decide between two really great choices.\n\nBut now, things have changed. There\'s still demand for people, and some people are getting jobs, but not across the entire industry. Our view from Berkeley is also a little distorted because we\'re one of the top schools, so most of our students are still getting offers.\n\nBut rather than getting five great offers, they might only get one great offer or an offer from their second choice. This is certainly not what we\'ve seen in the past.\n\nThere are also people coming from other schools that don\'t have quite the strong reputation that Berkeley does, and they\'re not getting job offers at all.\n\n**Some programming roles are disappearing**\n\nIt\'s not just the technology jobs that are being affected.\n\nAny ""hands-on keyboard job"" is at risk of being contracted out offshore or outsourced to AI.\n\nAnother problem is that many companies are also trying to consolidate a bit. These things are all coming together like a perfect storm.\n\nIn tech, programming positions that aren\'t that demanding are disappearing. You can now use a programming assistant that\'s based on a large language model to basically write a lot of code for you. So, where a company would have had to hire one or two people before, they no longer need to.\n\nThey are still entry-level jobs that involve basically babysitting the AI — but these systems are getting better very quickly.\n\nCertain specializations like CS-AI or data science still seem in high demand, but I\'m concerned that this may not last.\n\nThe job market is still shrinking, and I think that may accelerate over the next few years. It\'s definitely something we\'ve seen over the last two to three years, but this last year, it has accelerated.\nStudents are aware that the job market is changing, and many of them are considering specializing in AI or data science because they want to take advantage of this new situation.\n\n**We need to accept the idea of universal basic income**\n\nIt\'s tempting to say we\'ll somehow protect the jobs and prevent them from disappearing, but I don\'t know how successful that would be.\n\nIf a technology exists for doing something faster, better, and more efficiently, it\'s very hard to tell someone not to use that. We can\'t demand companies spend a lot more money and do it more slowly with a human person.\n\nThat approach would stifle innovation and business.\n\nI think we need to accept the idea of paying people a universal basic income — a system that gives people a basic amount of support that\'s not contingent on anything. That way if you get a job, you still get that basic support. But if you don\'t get a job, you still have support.\n\nI can understand when people have issues with UBI and question why the results of their work should be given to someone else.\n\nBut if machines are doing the work instead of us, then it\'s a different formula. Instead of taxing people, we would be able to tax the work done by machines or AI automation and use that to provide a basic level of income.', 'CS majors shouldn’t give up. They should realize that they need to be exceptional to get a job, and should work harder to be exceptional. It’s not impossible, it just takes hard work.\n\nFor exceptional CS majors, the job market is booming, with tons of opportunities everywhere.', ""Just being pragmatic: Trader Joes or Whole Foods jobs pay the rent and have good Glassdoor ratings...if you have a bf/gf or roomie.

1fyuk71,berkeley,Regret not going to Berkeley ,"As a transfer student who got into ucla and cal for civil engineering, I really do regret not going here and I feel like it chopped all of my motivation to do well in school. I chose ucla for simple reasons; I was really close to my family, (15 min without traffic) my girlfriend didn’t apply to Berkeley so we couldn’t have went here together, and lastly, for my major, the projected income difference between ucla and Berkeley was very negligible (5k more for Berkeley? I don’t remember, but they both line up to be the same after a couple of years) and it just felt like a safer school since it felt like I was making less sacrifices.  It’s been 2 weeks since the quarter started and it feels like the classes here seem weak; professors are not that good at teaching and no one really seems too interested in the subject or classes. This might sound a little dumb but I wanted an experience where I would face some sort of impostor syndrome where I would be astonished by the strength and dedication of my peers but I don’t feel this at ucla at all, it seems like most people are here to have fun and I realized this is not for me. and ucla gets upmost praise for its atmosphere but as someone who is doing engineering I never enjoyed the party style it has and find 0 appeal in it. I understand that I have my parents and my girlfriend very close to me now, which I am undoubtably grateful for, but often I imagine how different my life could have went if I just stuck with Berkeley since fafsa wasn’t really an issue to me (very low income). I could have seen myself doing long distance and then coming over to see my parents and my girlfriend frequently. If long distance failed, then I could have just said it was never meant to be and move on. Why am I posting this? I don’t know. I guess I might be looking for some sort of reassurance that in the end, for my major at least, and while berkeleys engineering is undoubtedly superior, it wouldn’t make a big difference to me career wise since I am not planning on pursuing a masters. Besides career opportunities, I feel like berkeleys life would have been more suitable for me, and perhaps, I am being entitled and taking what I have for granted regardless since I have the opportunity to be going to ucla for free.(Berkeley would have likely costed a few thousand, but, negligible when you think about the career opportunities it could provide.)","[""Tbh, you have no idea what could have happened had you gone to Berkeley. Obviously, maybe it would've been a more positive experience, but it could've also been a more negative one. Personally, there was a point in time where I strongly regretted choosing a major at Berkeley vs a different major at Davis, but at the end of the day I realized that the what if's will forever be what if's and it's better for me to focus on the present, and now I'm really happy to be here at Berkeley. You had two great options in Berkeley and UCLA, and I assure you whatever choice you made would've left you wondering about the other. UCLA's a great school and I wish you the best. Hopefully this was helpful :)"", 'I think there is no wrong decision and you shouldn’t feel bad/regret now. Just try to seek people who seem excellent or cool at UCLA and you’ll be glad with where you’re at :)', 'OP - you sound like you are looking across at seemingly greener pastures. regardless of how you got here, you still set yourself up for success. learn from this, make the most of your current situation and figure out the next best steps for yourself. in a handful of years, you will be the only person that remotely cares whether you chose ucla or cal.', ""The nerd mothership has a strong siren call. But UCLA can be just as engaging if you make it so. Find your crowd and make the best of it! Some of my best friends are from UCLA. And they did enjoy their time there.

Legit what are they doing with the millions of dollars in donations, grants, and corporate deals?

The CAA is being run to fund the lifestyles of its lazy executives and not worthy of any university. I have seen high schools doing better.

This will sabotage the long term success of this university and its students.","[""I'm not the one whose pockets are being fattened through CAA.

Where are your priorities? Do you want to make career connections? Do you want to watch football? Do you want to help with scholarship selection? Do you want to meet hot Cal alumni singles in your area? Seriously, please tell us your needs because we are trying to cater to our audiences.\n\nFrom my perspective,  the thing *my* club struggles with is getting consistent participation. Sure, plenty of alumni in the area, but we're lucky if they show up to two of our events before vanishing from our radar. Covid really killed our momentum in terms of growth and engagement. But we're still around, putting on events in your communities. They might not get posted on the CAA website, but they'll go out in email newsletters or get posted to Facebook. That's because we're in charge of managing our own announcements and social media, and I, for one, am not great at that.

Each events are planned and coordinated by the volunteers, and if there is any funding, it's almost always reimbursement for these events which is a separate paperwork and has a somewhat tight limit on the amount.\n\nI noticed your comment that you want to tap into the Cal professional network, and I think that is a fantastic idea especially in today's economy, but quickly realized this should be an initiative by the main CAA office.\n\nThe main CAA office in Berkeley are also run by a lean number of staff from what I can tell, starting with responding to various emails from the chapters and website maintenance, especially regarding promoting the events and providing a path for those who want to join.\n\nMy observation is the main CAA office could use a lot more support as well so that they have the time and funding to promote the professional networking events and others that aren't really in the domain of local chapters -- the staff are very good, but I am seeing signs of being overworked, and if anything, underfunded."", 'As an alumna, I feel overall very disconnected from Berkeley. I will always be proud to have attended and thankful for what I learned during my time, but the university and even my department and professional club have done nothing to keep up with me, even as I’ve continued to achieve in my field (which I studied/started in at Cal). The newsletter put out by my department rarely features prior undergrads and when it does, it seems to be based on them maintaining a strong connection to an existing faculty member (my own advisor has since left for an ivy league school on the east coast). It’s begun to really annoy me, actually, because being an alum is supposed to confer benefits and connections for life and that just has not been the case here.', 'For real, you don’t need to join the CAA to go to local chapter events either', ""The Bay Area chapters are going to be the least active - because the University is right there. If Alumni are in the area and want to get connected, they can just drive to Berkeley (although I would note to try and look and see what the main connection point is for that specific club is - it probably isn't the website)\n\nHere's my experience with the 4 alumni club chapters since graduating:\n\n- Hong Kong, very heavy with the big alumni events. Annual Berkeley Gala where the chancellor, vice chancellor, VIP and standout students (HK Olympians, Golden Overtones, Oski, etc. fly out to attend). Monthly Happy Hours/Networking, often with other T25 US Universities + Oxbridge. Very few casual events - when the football team is good they may have viewing parties. Facebook and email are main communcation.\n\n- Shanghai - apparently people (both job recruiters and also people faking being Berkeley grads) keep trying to infiltrate the WeChat group chats and pose as Berkeley grads. Lots and lots and lots of industry centric networking events. Regular Happy Hours, but very little attempts to connect with anyone, just a bunch of people looking to move up and gain a bigger group of contacts. About a decade ago, had more young alum, social events. Share the big events title (Berkeley Gala) with Hong Kong. There's at least 4 diffferent wechat groups that I'm a member of through the Shanghai alumni association\n\n- Houston - small and at the time I lived in Houston, only occasionally active - did some high school recruiting for Berkeley at the very big high school college fairs\n\n- Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley - super super active.

1fywsg0,berkeley,Berkeley-related Nobel Prizes: October 8. 2024 update (a long-time-ago Berkeley connection for one of the Physics Nobelists),"Well, the **Nobel Prize in Physics** was announced at 2:45 AM, Berkeley time today. I happened to be up (wasn't sleeping well because of the lingering hot weather) so I watched. The Prize was awarded to two winners, Geoffrey Hinton and **John Hopfield**, *""for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.""*

Hinton, who is currently on the faculty at the University of Toronto, is most notable for his work on AI and, most recently, his public warnings and concerns about the risks of AI.

Hopfield is currently age 91, and emeritus faculty at Princeton University, so this goes down formally as another Nobel for Princeton (and U.Toronto).

**He does have a UC Berkeley connection in his past, though**. **He was on the faculty in Physics at Berkeley from 1961-**6~~3~~ **64**, as both an Assistant and an Associate Professor, so was moving up the academic ladder. He would have been in his late '20s, then.

The sequence of his academic life seems to have been: Bachelors from Swarthmore, Ph.D. (Physics) from Cornell, two years at Bell Laboratories, a year or so at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, then (according to Wikipedia) *""subsequently a faculty member at University of California, Berkeley""*, then Princeton, then CalTech, then a return to Princeton.

The Berkeley connection is nice, but if we want to avoid TOO tangentially claiming association with a Nobel (and, from my perspective, that's the best path) he is not really a ""Berkeley Nobelist"". He wasn't on the Berkeley faculty when he won the award, and he's not a Berkeley alumnus, and he has several other distinguished academic / research appointments in his past.

The Princeton connection in particular is interesting because he writes in an autobiographical essay (linked at his Wikipedia page) that a particular line of research he was pursuing during his first period there came to what seemed like a dead end, and it sounds like he and the Physics department there agreed it would be best if he left Princeton. Thus his time at Caltech, but then eventually a return to Princeton with a faculty appointment in Molecular Biology. Lucky university!  They already feature him at the top of their webpage, in less than an hour after the award was announced. Quick work by their public relations staff.

**So. in summary, Berkeley contributed to Hopfield's academic career as a faculty member / researcher, but he was only on the faculty here for a few years, early in his long career.**

Princeton, by the way, claims as Nobelists:  *""Faculty, students and staff listed here performed their award-winning work at Princeton, were employed by or studying at Princeton when they received their award, or are currently working at the University. Alumni recipients are denoted in italics. An asterisk is used to denote graduate alumni.""* [*https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/honors-awards*](https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/honors-awards)

Hopefully we'll hear more about Hopfield's Berkeley connection later.

1fzaseb,berkeley,Ac transit confusion,"Hi! So is it me or has the ac transit system (or at least the 51b) not been doing great lately?

I'm talking very late buses, buses that completely skip you or anything like that. It's been a big problem for me lately and It's really wierd because I thought the transit system was great last year.

Today I got on the 51B in Elmwood to get to class. I got on and the bus just sat there. I thought it would be fine but we ended up sitting there for 16 minutes and not moving. We tried asking the driver what happened but he wouldn't say anything. He even asked someone if they needed medical help even though they were just calmly sitting there? I ended up late to class and only made it at all because someone on the bus happened to have their car parked nearby and offered to give me a ride.

That class ended up getting cancelled so i got on a different bus back home but we passed by that same 51b stop and the bus was still there 30 minutes later. I have no idea what that was about. 

My point is the ac transit system has been annoying for me lately and I'm just wondering if anybody else feels the same.

Berkeley is one of the largest public universities in America. Our Courses are big. Our Sections are Big. And Our Brains are big.

However, it can be hard dealing with so much success. In such large classes, it can be hard to make friends and feel connected. 

That is why [speakiez.com](https://speakiez.com/auth/register) was made. Where only students with a [berkeley.edu](http://berkeley.edu) email can join.

Speakiez is a website where students can input their course schedule (lectures, discussion sections, etc.). Basically for every course there is a dedicated server/chatroom where you can talk with everyone in your class called Lecture. Then there is a dedicated server/chatroom where you can talk with everyone in your discussion section, this is called Section. You can also create text channels limited to a certain number of people as well for any topics you want to talk about. You can talk about having roommates who really like football, or roommates who really hate football!

The goal is for Speakiez to be used during the lecture or discussion section. On the side of everyone’s laptop is a website that allows you to chat with everyone in that room. Ask questions anonymously to a TA, or chat with other students during the 10 minute wait until Berkeley Time hits.

Ask Questions, Provide Insights, Post Memes. Whatever you want.

Once again the website is [speakiez.com](https://speakiez.com/auth/register), where communication flows. Register [here](https://speakiez.com/auth/register), and join the website made to communicate with people like you!

If you would like to see this succeed, let us know. Shoot me a DM or leave a comment. You can even share this website with your TA, if you would like.

I was studying near the Social science building, and I realized I had to take a dump, so I went to the social science building restrooms, and I went to the very last stall. I noticed a guy came in a minute after me and then proceeded to go to the stall next to mine. I was a little confused by this but kept doing my business, then I noticed he was lurking over the overhead part of the restroom stall, and then he made a comment about private parts, after this, I felt uncomfortable and I tried to leave the restroom, however, he tried stopping me and kept trying to engage in I'm not exactly sure..., after I was finally able to leave the restroom he then proceeded to follow me outside of the building till I made it to an overpopulated area. Then I was able to get to my dorm. The whole thing kept me shaking, what would happen if I couldn't leave the restroom, what if he recorded me, what if I was never able to make it to where people were?

updated: Jan 29, 2024 - added FAQ by Jordan Else, AATA link and city report on waitlist fees.

Questions, answers, and information about everything housing can go here.

* [Housing Survival Guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1A0eZ4UH8XNkFl4yW0yFImyyzAEw5qp-o) by u/fluffymoomin - PDF guide. Essential to avoid being scammed.


**Listings:**

* [Area Facebook Housing Groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q1JGSRwOZ6BPzsi-fjiSrZwPiKmmGcrKrLmVX1UnUC4/edit#gid=0) - Facebook group list compiled by u/fluffymoomin - Groups are listed with descriptions as well as safety recommendations. Not all groups are moderated well, be careful regardless of the group, moderators are human. Do not pay money to post in any facebook group. It's a scam. The ones that ask for money are no different, or worse than the free ones. Any reply asking you to message or dm them is likely a scam.

* [UofM offical off-campus housing site](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/) - You can now sort by recently updated listings. You can post listings or as a person looking for housing/roomates.

* [Ann Arbor off-campus housing](https://www.annarboroffcampus.com/) - This was the site that uofm used as their official site until it was replaced with the site above. One of the biggest gripes I had with this version is that commercial properties were updated every day, so sorting by new was tedious to find new listings as a bunch of the same commercial properties would be ""updated"" each day to be at the top.

* [Zillow (ann arbor)](https://www.zillow.com/ann-arbor-mi/rentals) - Zillow

* [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/off-campus-housing/mi/ann-arbor/university-of-michigan-at-ann-arbor/) - Apartments.com

* [ICC Co-ops](https://icc.coop/) - Inter-Cooperative Council page for Co-op housing. 

* [Craigslist Apartment search](https://annarbor.craigslist.org/search/apa) - Usually spammed by the same area complexes over and over, which is what made craigslist so hard to use and forced people to facebook. There are still some listings here though, it just takes some scrolling.

The listed rents are low, at least 2-3 years old, maybe more, but gives a good overview of the entire area. **Most comprehensive listing I've seen in a readable format.** Only reason this isn't under listings is because all of the rents quoted are old and there are no links to the actual websites, just a form for contact email that goes who knows where. Use this to find places to look at more in depth, contact them directly on their actual websites.

**Remember to exercise caution when looking for housing.** Lots of scammers out there. Check their main profiles if on facebook to see if they match the user who reached out to you. See if you can verify them anywhere else that they actually live in the area. Beware of people pushing you to send deposit money without showing you the place. Please refer to the PDF survival guide located at the top of the post. It can save you money and just as importantly time, not having waste time and effort to interact with scammers. Most instances of people telling you to message them as replies to your posts on facebook are scams. Make sure they have listings on the group, not just replies to people looking as comments like that can't be screened. Most legit people will contact you first and have a listing already in the group.


**Fall sublets will be uncommon.** Most of the Winter sublets you've seen posted are people who failed to find a Fall-only sublet and are trying to recoup some of the un-used lease remaining. Be especially wary when searching for Fall-only sublets. Scammers count on people being desperate to bypass their warning senses. Some apartment complexes like Woodbury Gardens(2-15 and 21 month), and the complexes owned by Village Green(6 and 9 month) may offer shorter lease terms than 12 month. Be aware the shorter term leases will be more expensive per month.
Mckinley Properties don't allow less than 12 month lease but they offer a early termination option which costs 2x monthly rent and requires a 60 day notice. This could be just as good as a shorter lease. I'd confirm it with the leasing office but this should be for all washtenaw county mckinley properties.


The Ann Arbor city bus line can make some affordable locations more practical. Your student ID lets you ride free. A short bus ride can be not too much worse than a medium/long walk. Beware some buses run more commonly than others

1g076f9,uofm,"First Year Roommate Issues (80% Rant, 20% Plea for Advice and Support)","First year student having problems with my roommate and don't know what to do or if I am overreacting. Partial vent and partially need advice.

Went in random and I met her and she seemed really sweet. We have a similar family structure and both are only children and seemed to get along fine. She suggested we share my microwave and kettle and offered to share her fan but I have my own.

  
I have been having some issues with her since we moved in. Keep in mind that this is a partial vent so not all of these problems are actionable and some are just annoying. Long rant incoming.

The first week, she basically didn't really want to make friends at all because she found out her acquaintance from high school lived down the hall. Her acquaintance was nice but very quiet and the acquaintance's roommate seemed nice but was also kind of harsh and genuinely mean. I said we should go meet people so we went to a welcome week event. I met people and kept hanging out with them and became a small friend group while she stuck with her one acquaintance and her friend from high school's ex who lived across the hall. All good. Roommates can have different friends. Not a crime.

But even at this point when I was still friends with my roommate, she was kind of mean about my friends. She kind of insinuated that two of them were trashy because they seemed like the kind of people to go to frat parties (which in my opinion isn't some kind of sin and they don't even go to frat parties so it doesn't matter?).

During this point, she tells me a lot of personal stuff and gets really upset about this and I try and comfort her as best as I can because she genuinely seems like a nice person.

Continuing on, this first week she meets a guy who flirts with her and she likes him. This leads to her leaving her friends alone in our dorm room with the door open while she goes away for an hour with this guy and I had been out the whole day. They're still in there when I want to go to bed at 10:45pm and I ask if she can keep people out after 9pm-ish. She says yes.

Then I get COVID and am home for a week. I come back and she tells me first that she made out with the guy in our room and then eventually it comes out that they are friends with benefits and had sex when I wasn't there. It really weirds me out but I kind of froze up and just didn't say anything about that. The weeks go on and she has an on and off relationship with this guy and tells me about it late at night so I stay up talking to her about it and feel sick in the morning because I'm not sleeping but she seems nice and I want to be nice. Then he is mean to her and she comes back crying and I comfort her and don't sleep that night either.

We now have completely separate friend groups and I notice now that she and her friends treat me weird. They talk to me as if I'm stupid and vapid, and she makes slightly rude comments about my friends if I mention things that they do (like going to the frats on the weekends). I try to be as friendly as I can anyways because I could be imagining things.

I go home every weekend. I come back to find that she's used my fan over the weekend without asking and used my paper towels and left her friend's dirty dishes on my desk. But she is a nice girl and I'm sure there are things about me that she doesn't like and keeps to herself.

Then the worst thing out of everything happens. I am working on an essay and exhausted because I’ve had three back to back important essays over the past few weeks and have finally hit a writer’s block wall. I come back to the room after crying and she asks what is wrong. I say something along the lines of “I’m so tired, I wish I had a longer break after IB because I feel like we barely got time off and I’m still exhausted” because I really did work hard at school and I really am tired. She tells me something along the lines of how it’s a privilege to be here and I brush it off as her trying to be comforting and say that I need to pee and will be right back. I come back to the room and I walk in on her friend saying “You can’t come to college with that kind of mindset”, clearly talking about me. It’s 12am and I just hold back tears and sleep in my friend’s room for the rest of the week.

Since then, I’ve been angry. How many sleepless nights did I waste? How many times did I hold my tongue about things she did? And she just turned around and clearly talked shit about me with her friend when I was at my lowest.

She apparently wants to be an RA so now all of a sudden she wants a roommate contract. I told her I didn’t want to talk about it until I finished a midterm I was stressed about. She tracked me down to my friend’s room and insisted that I talked to her about it last night and I was just so tired that I let her push me over once again and signed a contract I didn’t actually agree to. The whole conversation really bothered me, especially the way she acted as if she was allowing me to stay at my friends’ room overnight sometimes when the only reason I do it is because she makes me so miserable that I can’t fall asleep in our room.

But I’m done. I’m exhausted and tired and she causes me so much extra stress when I really do have a good life at this college. I’ve been miserable for months and it’s all because of the weight of her behavior on me because I’m too much of a pushover to bring it up. But I’m done. I filed a room switch request and I am going to text her tonight and tell her that I did not agree with what she put in the roommate contract and will not talk to her about it until after my midterm. I’ve been half living out of my friends’ room and will maybe keep doing that until the midterm is done and then sit down and at least hammer out a roommate contract that I can live under until I get a room switch. My parents don’t know about the room switch because they say my roommate is a nice girl despite all of this. I know it could be worse, but the relief completely outweighed the guilt I felt filling out that room swap form.

Does anyone have any other advice beyond this? I have already talked to the RA about this but she likes my roommate better and generally takes her side no matter what.","['You keep saying she’s a nice girl. I’m not so sure about that. She seems very self centered and inconsiderate. Personally I prob wouldn’t go home as much either.  She’s taking over your room like mold.\nEdit to add: F her!', 'Get into contact with your buildings hall director. They should be able to help you if your RA is not', 'You need to start putting boundaries down and sticking with it. You are not being mean in doing so either. She can talk to you about her problems in the morning so you can sleep. She can stop using your things. She can stop badmouthing you. It sucks, but these are things you have to bring up to her. \n\nAlso, she does not seem very nice. Why is she determining what is good or bad? If we are going by her logic that “partying is bad,” then we can say that “having a friends with benefit relationship” is also bad. Like I don’t understand why her and her friends are first assuming things about you/your friends and second, determining it to be the worst thing ever. \n\nAnd like what others have said, get in contact with your buildings hall director. Since this is making you unable to sleep due to the stress, it is a serious problem and you need to make sure they know it is. Be firm with how much it is impacting you emotionally/academically.', 'Like others said, set boundaries (sooner).  Also, why are/were going home each weekend?   Not asking you to answer here, but it could be helpful to do some internal reflection on this.  Do you have family responsibilities you have to attend to?

1g0gk8a,uofm,POLL: Do you approve of the SHUT IT DOWN administration?,"BACKGROUND: SHUT IT DOWN was elected in the Winter 2024 semester and has blocked 2 different budgets, followed by a failed attempt to block a third budget this last Tuesday.  They began the semester by de facto blocking all legislation by staging walkouts of multiple CSG meetings.

The president of CSG has left numerous seats in the Executive cabinet vacant, along with every ex-officio position in the Assembly (including representatives for transfer and international students). Additionally, the SHUT IT DOWN executive has published about half the typical “Executive Reports” which are to be delivered at each public meeting, on their progress of their actions.

SHUT IT DOWN has co-sponsored a few acts, all entirely at the Assembly level including reforms to various rules and declaratory resolutions that condemn specific actions but do not have subsequent operative clauses to make changes. Some others include Disability advocacy, an examination of how student org funding is utilized, and condemnation of police brutality on campus.

Over half of SHUT IT DOWN’s members have either resigned or been recalled due to excessive absences at CSG meetings, including the former Ethics Chair.

The SHUT IT DOWN administration has used Instagram to call for its supporters to “pack CSG” at multiple meetings, including the most recent CSG meeting where multiple CSG members reported being threatened on campus, followed outside of the meeting, and one non-member being allegedly spat on. Every SHUT IT DOWN member I spoke to denies these accusations.

For more information about CSG and the legislation that has passed this year, please visit https://csg.umich.edu/

FYI: I tried to stick to the facts and on the record allegations by CSG members. If there is anything you believe I am missing, as long as it is supported by the facts, please let me know and I will edit the post. I am not trying to be excessively negative, just documenting the reality of the last 7 months in CSG, which I have covered extensively here. Also, if you are directly involved as a speaker, CSG member or former CSG member, please let me know. I’d really love to put people’s firsthand knowledge on display to increase the transparency of what is currently occurring in CSG.

Also, please do not engage in ad hominem attacks in these comments. Attack the issues, the platforms and do so with critical thought. Please downvote anyone just regurgitating tired talking points and generally being unproductive. Thank you.

EDIT: It appears the CSG website is not fully up-to-date on the legislation tab. So far this year, over 2 dozen bills have passed, half of them without any operative clauses that make changes (either communication or declaratory resolutions only). They are listed on the agendas but the Master List on the “legislation” tab is outdated.

1fygkbf,uofm,"So unbelievably, mind-numbingly, gut-wrenchingly lonely","Don't really know why I'm here. It's nice to know this subreddit exists. I guess I just needed to get this out so someone here knew there was a student in their ranks who is struggling and at the end of a long and very tired rope. A lot of you have probably seen me walk by you and don't even know it. I'm all over North and Central Campus.

I am a transfer student and in several organizations. I also work at a large company when I'm not here. I'm an older student. Every day, every week, I am surrounded by coeds and colleagues who are almost half my age. People my age seem to be in all the areas I'm not, and vice versa.

Never in my life have I felt more alone than I do now. How can I be surrounded by thousands of other people and feel like I don't belong at all, like I have no place anywhere in my life? I feel so isolated, so cut off from everything and everyone. Even my therapist has nothing to say except offering her condolences for feeling so disconnected from everyone. She suggested finding a support group outside of the university that has people my age, but where is the time for that? Life is a packed schedule of lean nonsense with little fat to clip.

Where did I go so wrong, to be at school so much later in life, to be working at a company full of people younger than me, and unable to find anyone I can relate to? How did such a seemingly-happy childhood devolve into an existence where if I were to disappear tomorrow, not a soul would notice?

I come home to a tiny apartment and try to pretend it's just another fine day in the books, but there comes the inevitable staring at the wall, feeling like I'm looking into the void of my soul that is missing such a fundamental connection and purpose in life. Not even a friend. No family to call. Just another day to come of walking as another face in the crowd, on the outside looking in.

For any of you who are quietly struggling on campus, you're not alone. I'm right there with you and struggling to keep on keeping on.

There is still a chance that both fail and are sent to the ballot box. Another outcome is that the Rebuilding Education in Gaza Act is ruled out of order per appropriations considerations in the All-Campus Constitution (see csg.umich.edu).  

A ton of other pieces of legislation are set for introduction, including multiple Disability Advocacy acts, a Scholarship Study Act, a Trans Protection act, and a bill to initiate the creation of a Psychology Minor in LSA.

I’d be happy to answer all questions about these proceedings as needed. Please be respectful in these comments. If you have criticisms, please attack the arguments and the logic rather than the individuals. People are in pain and we need to be constructive here.

1fxviqm,uofm,LING 137,"Warning because I’m about to be a mega hater but I have talked to many other people in the class this semester who all also feel this way. I have never seen a worse organized class before. I am a computer science major but have taken 2 linguistics classes in the past because I find the area of study interesting. The subject of LING 137 is pretty interesting, it’s basically about language standardization, and how no way of speaking is truly “incorrect”, and who decides what language is considered “correct” and “incorrect”.

The class is organized to be basically a “choose your adventure” kind of thing, where there’s a tonnnn of different assignments you can choose to do, and no late assignments are accepted since there's so many to choose from. However, in order to get an A in the class, you need to reach 1.2 MILLION POINTS. 1.2 million???? Out of a possible 2.9 million points. This grading scale is so absurd that the professor has to spend the first 15 minutes of each 50-minute lecture re-explaining how the grading system works. The smallest assignments are worth 5,000 points which is also ridiculous, I just don’t understand why everything needs to be in the thousands because it makes it feel way more overwhelming. We use GradeCraft so that you can hypothetically plot out which assignments you want to do, but there are so many goddamn assignments, most of which are 50,000 points or less, so it's just ridiculous to expect each student to go through and spend like an hour plotting this out. Plus, they grade the assignments really hard so you can’t actually plan out what you’ll need to do. Many of the assignments are multiple page essays, which is usually not expected of a 100-level linguistics course. In my other 100-level linguistics course, we had a simple worksheet to do every week or every other week. The instructors have to know that the vast majority of the people in this class were planning on taking it as an easy class to balance out their schedule.

I understand the idea behind this grading system - it’s to allow students wiggle room if they get sick or have a busy week so they don’t have to do assignments that week, and so students can pick and choose which assignments are actually interesting to them. But since there are so many assignments, many of them barely make sense. The past several weeks, 35 minutes out of the 50-minute discussion have been spent going over the instructions for upcoming assignments because the entire class is so confused over them. It really sucks because the course content is actually pretty interesting, but we move sooooo slowly through the lecture everyday, and it feels like we’re barely learning anything new. I could go on and on about all the things that frustrate me about this class, but I just needed to get this off my chest because every time I go to do an assignment for the class, I get so annoyed. I'm guessing that I and most people will still end up with an A in the class, but there is just so much unnecessary stress and confusion for a grading system that the class hates.","[""Lmao I'm sorry. This sounds Kafkaesque. Hope it doesn't sour you on linguistics altogether."", 'Millions of points feels absolutely insane imo.

Only reason i say that is I have NEVER heard of any other class at umich grading like this, but i could just be reading into it too much (an interesting thought if that’s what they’re doing, but horrible execution if it affects students grades).', 'I am also in this class and feel the same way. Even though they say that you can choose what assignments to do, the amount of points we need to get an A makes it seem like that’s not even an option. The due dates make no sense to me. I feel like I’m always rushing to complete stuff the day of. I hate that none of the assignments are due at 11:59 pm. For example, why are there four assignments due at noon on Sundays? Also why are the after class comments due at noon the day after lecture? At first I was able to keep up but now that I have midterms for other classes I’m starting to miss the majority of weekly assignments in the class.

For context, I’m living with a close friend, and the rest of our friend group has graduated. 

For freshman-junior year we were pretty active socially, from Greek life to going to the bars every weekend and tailgating in the fall. This year I’m feeling uninterested in all of those things- I’ve yet to go out at all and have gone to one game. Really all I want to do is focus on my schoolwork, spend time alone, and do more lowkey activities (ie trying new restaurants, going to movies, etc). 

I will say that I am taking a very challenging courseload that is overwhelming me a bit, and is maybe contributing to this. 

My friend thinks it’s extremely abnormal and pathetic of me to not want to make the most of senior year and have fun- is it? 

More importantly, am I being a bad friend by sitting out of a lot of these social activities (football games, going out, etc) that we used to do together, but I’m no longer interested in at all? I’m her only main friend on campus, and I feel like I’m being selfish by sitting out/prioritizing my schoolwork/doing what’s convenient for me.

But I don't believe that's an objective issue of being a good or bad friend, it's just how you are right now. Friendship should include doing things that you mutually enjoy, and occasionally doing things you don't necessarily enjoy because your friend needs some help or just to make them happy. If what you're offering doesn't satisfy your friend's needs as a friend, and they stop considering you a friend, I wouldn't say either of you are in the right or in the wrong, it's just that you have different desires."", 'Recent grad - I had a similar experience.

I still enjoyed going to all the home games, but I pretty much just wanted to stay home and chill. \n\nYou are definitely not the asshole.

1fyo9hx,gatech,Honest Opinion on IE program? ,"As someone who is really interested in the IE program at tech, I have a couple of questions

1. How difficult are the major related classes compared to core classes? Particularly the math that is taught? Now I know that its tech and its engineering so thats pretty much straightforward but because its considered the ""easiest"" engineering major, does the math completely bend one over or is it manageable? What math skill does probability and statistics heavily rely on?
2. I heard to get into many of the major related classes, it would take around 1-2 years to finish all the prerequisites. Would it put me behind if i started to take major related classes junior year? Do the classes get filled really quick?
3. How are the professors and the learning environment?","['Top rated program with great college placement internships leading to hires! Take it!', 'It’s the #1 IE program if it isn’t good here, it won’t be anywhere. I think it’s considered the easiest major because it cherry picks the easy intro classes of multiple other majors.

It’s hard to describe exactly what skills benefit one of these maths vs the other, but just know skill in one doesn’t always immediately translate. Like others have said, difficulty depends on your concentration (math in ADS or EFS is going to be more challenging than the math in SC for instance), so your own research will probably be the best answer. \n\nYou will have to go thru a bit of prereqs (ie 2027, cs 2316, calc 1-3) to get to classes like 3133, 3232, or 3044 but taking them maybe end of second year and definitely beginning of third year should set you up for concentration classes and senior design fourth year fairly well. What’s nice is the core major classes like those listed above plus 3025 and 3030 give you insight into what concentration to pick\n\nI will be honest, professors are hit or miss. All are really smart, but some are better teachers than others. Either way the class will provide you with the tools to succeed, you may just need more initiative in some cases than others.', 'From my experience nothing good in life comes easy.

1fxu59p,gatech,"Struggling as a first year, I feel like my brain is fried","Hey everyone! I’m a first year at Tech (this is my first semester) and I just wanted to come on here and rant about some frustrations since coming here.

I never thought I would end up at Tech because truly I applied on the whim. However the school I wanted to go to didn’t really work out especially cost wise. So here I am at the next best option. But to cut costs I’m commuting and the travel time is around an hour with traffic. I have classes 5 days a week (most of which are 8:00 ams) so not only do I have to get up 2 hours earlier than most people but I also get home later which really sets me back when it comes to doing homework or studying, because by the time I get home I just want to rest.

I have been doing my assignments on time however I don’t feel like I’m learning anything. It feels as if I’m doing the work just to do the work. And it’s not that I don’t want to learn, but it’s that everyday there is a new topic and I don’t have the time or the mental capacity to truly retain much of it especially when I’m taking 15+ credits this semester. It’s like during the class I’ll understand, but right after it’ll just leave my mind because now I have to focus on another subject. But when I get back to the previous subject, we’re already learning a new topic. I just feel like I can’t yk? Like I just can’t. I’ve thrived on academic validation my whole life, so seeing how I’m struggling with my classes hurts me as a person. I want to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA for my scholarship but at this rate it’s just so hard.

I’ve went to tutoring, I’ve went to office hours, I’ve went to recitations, and I’ve even done study groups. But barely have they helped. I even have regular appointments at the mental health resource center. But it has truly taken such a toll on my emotional and mental state because in all honestly I feel stupid and dumb being at tech and just so behind everyone else. Everyone seems like they know what they’re doing and what they want to be in life and here I am just stuck. 

I’m so tired and burnt out man like what can I do?? Seriously. I have no motivation, I feel burnt out and like my brain is fried, and every Sunday is like hell cause i know what the week holds.

I really feel like not many people actually come out and say how bad they’re struggling. So here I am actually saying I am STRUGGLING. Any advice? Or if anyone can relate please or have been through this, please tell me how you managed. And if anyone wants to be my mentor or something, please let me know cause I could really use one.","['When I was a TA, I saw students who lived far off campus struggle.

I’m a student who just returned to Tech this semester after going through the readmission process. Unfortunately, things have been really rough since the start. Literally a day before the semester began, some unexpected issues with my housing came up, and I ended up having to live in my car for the first six weeks of the semester. While my housing situation has stabilized now, my commute is about 40 minutes each way (without traffic), which is still adding a lot of stress.

All of this combined has put me in a constant game of catch-up. I’m barely finishing homework on time, and when midterms came around, I had to choose between studying or completing assignments. I’ve been trying really hard to hold everything together, but I feel like I’m slowly losing my grip.

My grades have been slipping, and I’ve had the worst midterm performances of my academic career so far (I got a 51, 70, 73, 70, and 87). I feel like I’m in a hole that’s getting deeper at a rate of 3x, and I can only climb out at 2x. I’m really starting to lose hope and can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Is there anything I can do to maybe buy myself some time, or any steps I can take to get back on track? Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks.","['Reach out to the dean of students.

1fxabl0,gatech,"Student football fans, we have some things to work on","First off, it is amazing we are filling out BOTH endzones. I am so excited about how far we've come. This post is a little bit of venting and some constructive criticism about a few incidents during the Duke game, but overall, it is incredible to see our student body showing out to cheer on the Jackets!

Still, there are a few things we need to improve on to be the fanbase these players deserve.

Most importantly, I think we can all agree that the trash thrown on the field on at least three occasions was completely unacceptable. As a fanbase and school, we have a reputation to develop and uphold, and we will not be like certain other fanbases in our state and conference. If you need a more tangible reason, our team will be penalized during the game and that could result in serious consequences within the game.

Now, I'm sure the assholes actually doing this stuff aren't going to be reading this post. All I ask for from y'all is a zero tolerance for these types of things and make sure ""fans"" like this know that they do not belong in the student section.

On a less serious note, we really need to shut up when our offense is on the field. Chanting and cheering is cool when the stakes aren't too high, but if our team is trying to finish off a drive in the redzone, it does not help when their fans are shouting at them. Consistent homefield advantage is incredibly important and we will desperately need it against Notre Dame and Miami in the coming weeks. Help me out here and let your friends know to quiet down when we have the ball.

On the other hand, we have been fantastic in bringing the noise when we're on defense. Keep that up and turn it up to 11!

Maybe I'm overreacting to some of this stuff, and feel free to call me out if that's the case. This is just an extremely valuable aspect of student life for me and I felt like something needed to be said.

1fuwrzf,gatech,Second guessing my internship :(,"So I'm a 4th year EnvE + ALIS major (and CHIN minor) and my original graduation date was fall 2025. I got this internship offer in the spring and I'm really excited, but it's going to push my graduation date to spring 2026. I mean, there's nothing wrong with graduating spring 2026, but I feel like I need to ""get in the work force"" as fast as possible. I talked to both my ALIS and EnvE advisors and they were both basically like ""nope not at all,"" but I still am delusional thinking I may be able to pull it off.

The thing is: I have 12 classes left (4 KOR, 8 CEE)...Here was my plan for the spring:

- KOR 4002 (I talked with the professor beforehand and can do the class online)

- VIP (any VIP class, but just for 1 credit b/c I've taken a VIP class before for 2 credits)

- ECON 2105 (there was a section that was async this semester so I'm just praying there is an async one next semester)

- I was thinking of doing CEE research as well...

I was thinking I could take 4 classes over the summer, but higher level CEE classes aren't usually offered over the summer, same thing with Korean.

I know this sounds like super duper crazy and like out of it, but idk...I already feel bad about the possibility of me being a full on fifth year. I heard Cabrera speak yesterday saying ""oh yeah, we're not the best with 4 year graduation rate, we need to work on that"" as if it's the student's fault.

I was able to graduate in only 3 so deferring is never an issue. I did linear, 2340, info vis, a grad class, and VIP last fall and I was say it was way too much. If you have time to spare and graduation isn't coming up super soon, I would just hold off on redoing the class until you don't have a hectic workload because the class requires a lot. I would recommend taking the class maybe over the summer or with much easier calm classes like LMC electives to help balance out the workload. Just take into account what thread electives you plan to take and see if linear is required because I only had 2 classes with a linear requirement in my whole degree. And employers will not care, I have 8 offers at the moment and I got a D in the class so you'll be fine.

Now we are in that phase of the semester when I am highly rethinking my decision of even taking this course.

Now the problem is, I did not know how mismanaged the course was and dry the lectures will be. The professor just reads from slides, and the projects are killing me. It is very hard for me to go to office hours because they clash with my other classes. That said I did go to TAs a couple of times, but the course content is really hard, and I feel like I don't even understand what they are teaching me. I know, I sound dumb.

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit.
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence.
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html).

Etc.\n\nYou can't just read the procedure and kind of have an idea of what you're doing like in gen chem labs. You really need to understand exactly what is happening on a molecular basis and how this is going to help separate, purify, etc. whatever compounds you are dealing with.\n\nKnowing the techniques is especially important for the lab practical, where you are basically given a mystery mixture of 2 compounds and told to separate them without a given procedure. AKA you need to come up with the extraction and purification steps yourself.\n\nMake sure you are also caught up in lectures as well because lecture and lab are highly correlated, and the manual doesn't really give all the information you need to do the lab (e.g. you learn the reaction mechanism in lecture but the manual doesn't give it to you so you need to come up with one yourself).\n\nWhen you start learning proton NMR, ABSOLUTELY PAY ATTENTION AND KNOW IT BY HEART. Proton NMR literally comes up for the rest of orgo 1 lab and is  part of every single lab in orgo 2. You 100% need to know how to interpret the spectra and understand the theory behind it. You can't just copy off a friend because you'll fail quizzes and the lab final if you can't do proton NMR. If you have any questions, you must ask your lab instructor immediately during the experiment or in office hours before you are too far behind.\n\nAnd lab gets 10x worse in orgo 2 lol.
